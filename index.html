## <a id="ch1"></a>Chapter 1. Course/Bitcoin Protocol & Consensus: A High Level Overview/Intro
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 id="course-syllabus">Course Syllabus</h2>
<p>This course is a comprehensive and in-depth overview of the
fundamental concepts of the crypto space, with a particular emphasis on
Bitcoin. By building intuition first from the context of
cryptocurrencies, the first application of blockchain, we understand the
key strengths and distinguishing factors of blockchain versus
traditional database systems. We then leverage these core features of
blockchain to solve new problems.</p>
<p>The course is divided into 6 modules: Bitcoin High-Level Overview,
Blockchain History, Bitcoin Mechanics Technical Overview, Bitcoin in
Real Life, Game Theory &amp; Network Attacks, and Ethereum &amp; Smart
Contracts. </p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Bitcoin Protocol &amp; Consensus: A High-Level
Overview</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We begin with some fundamental concepts such as the basic properties
and intent of centralized/decentralized currency. We then build an
in-depth understanding of Bitcoin from the ground up, divided into
<strong><u>four</u></strong> stages: a. <strong>Identity</strong>, b.
<strong>Transactions</strong>, c. <strong>Record Keeping,</strong> and
d. <strong>Consensus</strong>. </p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>Blockchain History: From the Cypherpunk Movement to JP
Morgan Chase</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This module delves into the origins and historical significance of
Bitcoin. We look into the roots of Bitcoin in the Cypherpunk movement
and Libertarian ideals, and examine the revolutionary significance of
Bitcoin compared to some of its early predecessors. We then move onto
exploring the history of the crypto space as a whole.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Bitcoin Mechanics &amp; Optimizations: A Technical
Overview</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We examine the in-depth mechanics behind Bitcoin, such as the Bitcoin
network, cryptography and cryptographic hash functions, Bitcoin Script,
privacy, and hash commitment schemes.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><strong>Bitcoin In Real Life: Wallets, Mining, and
More</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We examine the most frequently used real-world aspects of Bitcoin,
such as wallets, wallet mechanics, mining, transactions, and Bitcoin
governance. We explain the various ways one can interface with the
Bitcoin network, depending on the specific software they run. </p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><strong>Game Theory &amp; Network Attacks: How to Destroy
Bitcoin</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We look into how to destroy Bitcoin, including various network
attacks. Specifically, we look into vulnerabilities such as pool
cannibalization, double spending and forking attacks, network attacks,
the Goldfinger attack, malicious mining profit strategies, and 51%
attacks.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><strong>Ethereum &amp; Smart Contracts: Enabling a Decentralized
Future</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This module focuses on the properties behind the second largest
blockchain platform, Ethereum. We introduce the Ethereum Virtual Machine
and the idea of Turing completeness and examine some of the key protocol
differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum, such as the UTXO vs. accounts
model and functionality. We then look into some of the use cases of
Ethereum, and conclude with an overview of smart contracts and building
decentralized applications. While the last modules primarily focus on
cryptocurrencies, this module encourages students to think about
blockchain use cases outside of cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Blockchain Fundamentals started off as the <a
href="https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/decal/fa16/">Cryptocurrency
DeCal </a>(Democratic Education at Cal, student run) course on UC
Berkeley campus in Fall 2016, taking inspiration from existing courses,
videos, and textbooks. From the beginning, the vision was to lower the
barrier of entry and provide a survey into the blockchain and
cryptocurrency space – to explain concepts from the ground up, as
clearly and concisely as possible.</p>
<p>Each semester since then, we have had many student volunteers take
time out of their already hectic schedules to help develop and fine-tune
content, to make Blockchain Fundamentals what it is today. </p>
<p>Blockchain Fundamentals is constantly being improved, in terms of new
information as well as course design, but its vision has remained
constant. Here are some of the major contributors to Blockchain

1: Course/Bitcoin Protocol &amp; Consensus: A High Level
Overview/Intro</h3>
<p>Welcome to the first module in Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and the
Crypto Space, the first course in the Blockchain Fundamentals
program.</p>
<p>Whether you’re an <em>enthusiast, trader, aspiring blockchain
developer</em>, or just a <em>curious individual</em> looking to learn
where and how blockchain can be used, you’ve come to the right
place.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology is poised to affect so much of the world today,
– in the financial, energy, identity, and IoT industries just to name a
few.</p>
<p>But blockchain use cases weren’t always this pervasive.</p>
<p>Throughout its infancy, blockchain found its primary use in
cryptocurrencies – and Bitcoin was its original inspiration.</p>
<p>To understand the wider crypto and blockchain space, we must first
seek to understand Bitcoin, the oldest and most widely understood
blockchain application.</p>
<p>Throughout this module, you’ll first learn what Bitcoin is and what
its primary motivations are.</p>
<p>Then, we’ll dive into four-part buildup of Bitcoin consensus and
explain why Bitcoin is built the way it is.</p>

class="uri">https://youtu.be/Gc2en3nHxA4</a> 1 min, 37 sec</h3>
<p>In this section, you will learn about the origins and motivations of
Bitcoin, and the key distinctions between cryptocurrencies and normal
currencies.</p>
<p>We’ll clear up some common misconception about Bitcoin and
Blockchain, and also explain briefly Bitcoin’s origins in the Cypherpunk
movement.</p>
<p>We’ll then draw a comparison between Bitcoin and Banks and analyze
each of the features and services they provide.</p>
<p>And this all sets the stage for the next section, in which we’ll
build Bitcoin from the ground up, incorporating each of these features
and services and seeing how they fit together.</p>

 </p>
<p>Most people struggle to answer the question, “What is Bitcoin?,”
because there are so many different ways to respond.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, Bitcoin is considered the first and the most
widely used cryptocurrency.<br/></p>
<p>A cryptocurrency is a completely digital, decentralized currency that
is built using principles of computer science, cryptography, and
economics. The term “Bitcoin” refers to the protocol governing this
currency.<br/></p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, bitcoin lowercase refers to the actual units
of currency.<br/></p>
<p>A Bitcoin user will say they have a certain amount of bitcoins,
similar to how we say we have a certain amount of dollars when referring
to the US Dollar.<br/></p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, Bitcoin is the inspiration for the
blockchain, which is the underlying data structure of this
cryptocurrency.<br/></p>
<p>A data structure is a virtual format for organizing, retrieving, and
storing information.<br/></p>
<p>The Bitcoin blockchain in particular stores a permanent history of
all transactions to ever occur in the history of Bitcoin.<br/></p>
<p>It is an append-only ledger, meaning that any information added to
the ledger cannot be deleted.<br/></p>
<p>But most importantly, Bitcoin is a cultural revolution.<br/></p>
<p>Rooted in ideals from Cypherpunks and libertarians, Bitcoin
represents a shift towards privacy and decentralization.<br/></p>
<p>This cryptocurrency is not backed by any central organization,
government, or company.</p>
<p>Instead, Bitcoin is built by the users, for the users.</p>
<p>As we said, Bitcoin was inspired by the Cypherpunk Movement of the
late 80s.</p>
<p>Cypherpunks advocate for the protection of privacy using
cryptography.</p>
<p>They don’t trust governments, corporations, or large organizations to
respect privacy.</p>
<p>These points of centralization accumulate a great deal of power over
society by collecting unimaginable amounts of information from millions
of users.</p>
<p>And the Cypherpunks were some of the first to be concerned about
central entities stripping away the freedom of the general public.</p>
<p>One massive point of centralization in modern day society is the
financial system, where:</p>
<p>banks govern the economies of entire countries.</p>
<p>Several different companies and researchers attempted to make a
decentralized or anonymous currency, but all of them failed.</p>
<p>Bitcoin was the first technology to succeed as a cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin whitepaper, or research paper, was published in October
2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
<p>The whitepaper was a 9-page, concise proposal for the structure and
function of a peer-to-peer electronic currency.</p>
<p>Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym, or a false identity, of an
individual or a group of individuals.</p>
<p>No one knows their real identity. However, what’s important is that
this whitepaper envisioned a currency where users do not rely on
financial interimagesries or trust anyone in order to make transactions
with each other.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, users do not need to use their real world identities;
instead, they are represented by addresses, strings of random letters
and numbers.</p>
<p>Bitcoin takes control out of the hands of third parties and gives
users the freedom to transact while protecting their privacy.</p>
<p>How does Bitcoin do it? On a high level, the Bitcoin network
validates transactions and stores the entire transaction history.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin network is a group of users communicating with each other
as part of the Bitcoin protocol.</p>
<p>This network serves as the substitute for the central bank and must
have certain properties to function correctly.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is trying to create an open, accessible cryptocurrency not
subject to censorship or centralization.</p>
<p>But what are the problems?</p>
<p>Keep in mind the problems of trying to create an open, accessible
cryptocurrency not subject to censorship or centralization:</p>
<p>There are no central parties to ask for information about user
accounts, and there are no central parties to kick out or censor
malicious users.</p>
<p>Decentralized networks generally suffer from these problems, leading
to inconsistencies between parties and malicious messages infecting the
network.</p>
<p>The most popular attack is known as the double spending attack, an
attack where some value is used for more than it i’s worth.</p>
<p>In real life, it’s easy to prevent double spending: since dollar
bills can’t be copied and pasted.</p>
<p>However, in digital currencies, there needs to be assurance that the
virtual tokens have not been promised to more than one person.</p>
<p>Bitcoin as a technology is trying to solve a very specific problem in
the realm of distributed systems: when any “node,” or computer within
the network, can come and leave as it pleases and behave however it
likes.</p>
<p>There are enormous possibilities for failures given the complete
removal of centralization, which is why there were so so many Bitcoin’s
predecessors to Bitcoin which failed.</p>
<p>So how does bitcoin solve these problems?</p>
<p>Bitcoin solves these problems through two things:</p>
<p>First, the blockchain, and the Proof-of-Work consensus protocol, both
of which are Satoshi Nakamoto’s most popular and influential
innovations.</p>
<p>Because of these two things, anyone with access to internet and a
computer can join the Bitcoin Network.</p>
<p>There are no banks or any equivalent of the Federal Reserve on the
Bitcoin Network.</p>
<p>Instead, everyone can verify and audit the transaction history on
their own.</p>
<p>And even the creation of money is decided not by a central authority,
but through the process of mining, or Proof-of-Work.</p>

</p>
<h3 id="bitcoin-vs.-banks">Bitcoin vs. Banks</h3>
<p>Bitcoin aims to get rid of the central entity, the bank.</p>
<p>In order to understand how it does that, we first need to understand
what purpose a bank serves and what features it provides to users, then
understand the parallels in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The first thing that banks do for us is manage accounts.</p>
<p>Banks verify that we are the legitimate owner of the bank account and
only we can spend the money or the funds. How does a bank do that? Banks
will ask us to provide identification before any activity can take
place.</p>
<p>Every transaction we conduct can be traced back to our identity.</p>
<p>On top of that, banks transfer and redeem money on your behalf.</p>
<p>We send money to each other through banks.</p>
<p>We rely on banks to honestly record our account balances.</p>
<p>This way, we don’t need to send money through envelopes to relatives
– we let these central institutions move money in safe and, established
ways on our behalf.</p>
<p>To keep track of all this information, we rely on banks to keep track
of our account balances.</p>
<p>Banks update our account balances whenever we make a new
transaction.</p>
<p>They also let us see statements so that you’re aware of your past
history of activity.</p>
<p>But most importantly, banks provide trust: banks are run by educated
professionals from top-tier universities and under the constant
regulation of the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>If you trust the quality of education and standards of the U.S.
government, then you can trust the bank.</p>
<p>But if you don’t, then you start looking for alternatives.</p>
<p>And this is where Bitcoin comes in.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at how Bitcoin can fulfill a bank’s functions.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------ Currency: Bitcoin Components ------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/Currency-Bitcoin components.png" alt="Currency: Bitcoin Components" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
 </p>
<p>In Bitcoin, identity and account management are completely
autonomous.</p>
<p>Each user of Bitcoin creates their own identity instead of asking a
bank to create one.</p>
<p>Anyone can generate a Bitcoin identity on their own.</p>
<p>This identity is disconnected from their real world identity,
providing a high degree of privacy.</p>
<p>On top of that, transactions are also peer-to-peer: instead of
talking to a bank which will talk to another bank which will eventually
talk to the recipient of some money, we can make transactions directly
can be made between with our peers and be confident that they are
confirmed by the rest of the network.</p>
<p>Therefore, in Bitcoin, users can send funds to each other directly
knowing that their transactions will be validated by the entire network
without the presence of a trusted third party.</p>
<p>To store all this information, each Bitcoin user gets to possess
their individual copy of the ledger.</p>
<p>This decentralized approach of record keeping ensures the integrity
of data despite the presence of faulty nodes who might record the
information dishonestly.</p>
<p>The decentralized nature of bitcoin also prevents the risk of single
point of failure.</p>
<p>In the event that a particular node is hacked in bitcoin, because
everyone is a record keeper, the rest of the network can still ensure
the integrity of the transaction record and keeps running.</p>
<p>But finally, there is still a need for trust in Bitcoin: instead of
trusting people in suits, we trust math and logic.</p>
<p>We trust that the Bitcoin protocol is correct, allowing us not to
trust the users and still have certainty that transactions are being
validated correctly.</p>
<p>We trust in the incentive alignment and publicly verifiable, tamper
evident ledger instead of our fellow users.</p>
<p>All of these pieces together make Bitcoin the technological
revolution that kicked off the Cryptocurrency Movement.</p>
<h3 id="intro-bitcoin-from-the-ground-up">Intro: Bitcoin from the Ground
Up</h3>
<p>We saw in the section on Bitcoin versus Banks that we need to enable
account and identity management, money transfer as a service, record
management, and trust.</p>
<p>In this section: titled Bitcoin from the Ground Up, we’ll take each
of these four concepts and see how they fit into Bitcoin’s
architecture.</p>
<p>By the end, you should have a high level understanding of how Bitcoin
works, and why things are the way they are in Bitcoin.</p>
<h1 id="intro-identity-stage-1">Intro: Identity (Stage 1)</h1>
<p>We’ll start off by taking a look at one of the most fundamental ideas
in Bitcoin:</p>
<p>Identity.</p>
<p>We saw earlier that banks need to keep track of the accounts and
identities of their customers.</p>
<p>But how do we do this in Bitcoin, without a bank or central entity to
keep track of who’s who and who owns what?</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------- Identity: Identity in Bitcoin ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image003-identity-in-bitcoin.png" alt="Identity: Identity in Bitcoin" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
 </p>
<h3 id="identity-stage-1">Identity (Stage 1)</h3>
<p>To understand why we need identity in Bitcoin in the first place,
let’s understand first why we need identity at all in the context of
currencies.</p>
<p>In currencies, we need to ensure that all users can authenticate
themselves through some identification method, and that all
identification methods have integrity.</p>
<p>Authentication is required to ensure that no one else acts on your
behalf.</p>
<p>Claiming, receiving, and spending money on your behalf are things
that only you should be able to do.</p>
<p>Like a bank, by associating yourself with your funds through
authentication, you are able to receive money from others and spend your
own money.</p>
<p>Only you have access to your own money, since others are not
authenticated to handle your money.</p>
<p>Without an authentication process, anyone could spend my money, which
is obviously undesirable.</p>
<p>Additionally, authentication can also be used to enforce blaming.</p>
<p>If someone tries to do something incorrect within the network, such
as spend someone else’s funds, you want to be able to call them out with
proof.</p>
<p>For example, if someone tries to withdraw your funds from a bank, you
would want a record of this, including the identity of who was trying to
take your funds, to get rid of malicious activity in the future by
banning or refusing to interact with those people.</p>
<p>Integrity, the other half of identity, means that all our
authentication methods cannot be replicated by anyone else.</p>
<p>We can understand integrity by the process of signing a check: once
you sign a check or transaction, no one should be able to intercept
and/or manipulate it.</p>
<p>The check has been signed by you, and since no one can replicate your
signature, it should be tamper evident.</p>
<p>Integrity ensures that no one but you, the signer, can use your
signature.</p>
<p>Imagine the following scenario in Bitcoin: If I wanted to send Alice
10 bitcoins, she shouldn’t be able to add another zero and make me send
her 100 bitcoins.</p>
<p>She also shouldn’t be able to copy or replicate my signature
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Only by preventing all these things can we trust the integrity of
Bitcoin identities.</p>
<p>Identity is a simple concept appearing everywhere in daily life.</p>
<p>For example, houses have both addresses and mailbox keys.</p>
<p>When you ask people to send you mail, you give away your address, so
they know where to send the package to.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you alone control the mailbox key.</p>
<p>Similarly, emails have aliases and passwords.</p>
<p>People who want to send you email have access to your email address
or alias, while you alone have access to the password to your email
account, so only you can read these emails.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, following this pattern, has both public keys and private
keys.</p>
<p>The items in orange on the left hand side – mailbox addresses, email
aliases, and public keys – represent one’s public identity.</p>
<p>They are what you give out to the public so that they know how to
communicate with you, so that they know how to recognize and identify
you.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the items on the right hand side in red – mailbox keys,
email passwords, and private keys – are secret keys that you alone
should own.</p>
<p>With these personal keys, you access the orange items on the
left.</p>
<p>It gives you control and ownership.</p>
<p>It gives you your identity.</p>
<p>If anyone else gets their hands on your email password, for example,
they can pretend to be you, receiving and sending emails on your
behalf.</p>
<p>Similarly, you would never want anyone else to have your Bitcoin
private key as that would give control of your Bitcoin public key and,
by implication, your Bitcoin identity.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- Identity: Public and Private Keys --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image004.png" alt="Identity: Public and Private Keys" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
 </p>
<p>In Bitcoin, you can think of your public and private key as a chest
and key, respectively.</p>
<p>You use your private key to prove you have ownership of your public
key and to access the funds associated with that public key, just as you
can use a physical key to unlock a chest that contains your physical
money.</p>
<p>To reiterate, <strong>public keys</strong> are used for
<strong>receiving</strong>, and <strong>private keys</strong> are used
for <strong>redeeming</strong>.</p>
<p>Received money is associated with the public key, and you can access
or spend those funds with your private key.</p>
<p>You are safe letting people know about your chest of bitcoins – your
public key – so long as you don’t give them the key to get inside – your
private key.</p>
<p>A small note: in actuality, other users send transactions to your
address, not your public key, as your Bitcoin public key is not
identical to your Bitcoin address.</p>
<p>Your address is actually derived from your public key.</p>
<p>We will make the distinction clear when we go more in depth into
Bitcoin mechanics, but you can for now think of addresses, pseudonyms,
and public keys as synonyms.</p>
<p>The reason why we need this public-private key pair scheme in Bitcoin
is because there is no central authority to generate unique identities
for users.</p>
<p>This means that users have to generate their own identities.</p>
<p>To generate an identity, a user picks a private key at random
generates the public key from the private key through a mathematical
function.</p>

<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image004-identity-few.png" alt="Identity: A few things to note" style="width:5in;height:2.82959in" /></p>
<p>You may be concerned about the danger of two users ending up with the
same public key without a central registry ensuring that no two people
have the same public key.</p>
<p>A bank, for example, has an internal list of users with unique
identifiers and can easily assign a new, unique identity to any new
user.</p>
<p>How do we simulate a bank’s identification process in Bitcoin?</p>
<p>How do we trust that no two users end up with the same identity?</p>
<p>To illustrate the probability of two users choosing the same identity
as someone else in Bitcoin, let’s consider something we’re all familiar
with: the Earth.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- Identity: Public & Private Keys ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image005.png" alt="Identity: Public & Private Keys" style="width:5in;height:2.81998in" /></p>
<p>Bitcoin has 2^160<sup>th</sup> different possible addresses.</p>
<p>To get a sense of how many different addresses exist for users to
choose out of, let us compare the number of addresses in Bitcoin to the
number of grains of sand on Earth.</p>
<p>The Earth has 2^63<sup>rd</sup> grains of sand.</p>
<p>Imagine every person in the world choosing a grain of sand at
random.</p>
<p>The likelihood of two people picking the same grain of sand is less
than 0.0001%.</p>
<p>In comparison, the number of addresses in Bitcoin is many, many
magnitudes greater than the number of grains on sand on Earth, making
the probability even smaller.</p>
<p>Let’s consider something more drastic: imagine that for every grain
of sand on Earth, there exists another Earth, also with
2^63<sup>rd</sup> grains of sand.</p>

<p align="center">

<p>Now we have 2^63<sup>rd</sup> times 2^63<sup>rd</sup> grains of sand
per earth, meaning that there are a total of 2^126<sup>th</sup> grains
of sand.</p>

<p>Even the number of grains of sand upon all these Earths is only
0.0000000058% (8 zeroes) of all the possible Bitcoin addresses.</p>
<h3 id="intro-transactions-stage-2">Intro: Transactions (Stage 2)</h3>
<p>So now that we have a clear understanding of the structure and
purpose of identity in Bitcoin, we can start asking the question, “How
do we make transactions between one another in Bitcoin?”</p>
After all, that’s the primary goal of the Bitcoin network – to enable
secure transactions between any two users in the network.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------ What Makes a Transaction Valid? --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image008-what makes-a-transaction-valid.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81998in" /></p>
<p>As we did before with the concept of identity, we will now be
analyzing the idea of a transaction.</p>
Take a moment to ask yourself, “What makes a transaction valid?”
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image009-validity.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81998in" /></p>
<p>For a transaction to be valid, it must have these three
components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>a proof of ownership, aka a signature,</p></li>
<li><p>available and sufficient funds to spend, and</p></li>
<li><p>a guarantee that no other transaction is using or has used the
same</p></li>
</ol>
<p>funds.</p>
<p>Let’s understand these criteria in the context of checks and
banks:</p>
<p>When you want to make a transaction via a check, you have to sign the
check to validate it – that’s a proof of ownership.</p>
<p>The bank then has to verify that you have enough funds in your
account – that you have available and sufficient funds for the
transaction.</p>
<p>They must also ensure that you do not spend the same money more than
once – that you cannot send two or more checks each spending 100 dollars
when your account only has 100 in total.</p>
<p>To ensure that one uses funds not in their possession, all the same
conditions apply to Bitcoin.</p>
To enforce this, Bitcoin uses what’s known as a UTXO, or Unspent
Transaction Output, model.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------  --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image010-utxo-model.png" style="width:5in;height:2.84871in" /></p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image010-utxo-2.png" style="width:5in;height:2.82959in" /></p>
<p>Traditionally, when we think of banks, we think of a single account
where all our funds are aggregated into one count.</p>
<p>For example, after buying $10 worth of burgers and fries, your
account balance goes from 20 to 10 dollars.</p>
<p>This is not the case with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Accounts are easy for users to understand but surprisingly difficult
for computers when it comes to all the complexity of a decentralized
network.</p>
<p>There is no longer a central entity to track all the transactions
being made by my account, nor a central clock to track when transactions
are being made.</p>
<p>If I make three different transactions of 5 bitcoins from an account
of only 10 bitcoins, which of the two transactions should go
through?</p>
<p>How do we ensure that we do not accidentally let all three
transactions go through?</p>
<p>To make transaction processing much easier and more secure, users do
not spend from an account; instead, they spend directly from
transactions made to them.</p>
<p>An easy way to wrap our heads around this unintuitive model is to
think of UTXOs as piggy banks!</p>
Every time a transaction is made to us, we put all that money into a
UTXO, or piggy bank.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------  --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image011-utxo-model-unspent.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81998in" /></p>
<p>When we want to spend money, we break open that piggy bank…spend
whatever we like, and then put the rest into another piggy bank.</p>
<p>(It’s hard to put a piggy bank’s shattered pieces back together.)</p>
<p>This way, the complexity of checking for transaction validity goes
down.</p>
<p>Instead of asking the more difficult question, “Is this account
trying to, at this time, spend more money than it owns across multiple
transactions?,” we only need to ask, “Does this single piggy bank have
enough funds?”</p>
<p>On the other hand, the complexity of keeping track of one’s own funds
goes up, as each of these piggy banks has to be tracked and secured
individually.</p>
<p>The amount of bitcoin you own is calculated by summing up the value
of each of your piggy banks, or UTXOs.</p>
<h3 id="utxos">UTXO’s:</h3>
<p>Here’s an example of how transactions work in Bitcoin:</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------  --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image012-utxo-example.png" style="width:5in;height:3.92747in" /></p>
<p>Let’s say that Gloria has two UTXOs, from past transactions, one
worth one hundred (100) bitcoins… and one worth fifty bitcoins.</p>
<p>She, being incredibly wealthy and generous, wants to send one hundred
and one bitcoins to me (Rustie).</p>
<p>To start off, she first breaks open the one hundred (100) UTXO and
makes that an input for the transaction to me.</p>
<p>However, she recognizes that she doesn’t yet have enough in the
input, so she breaks open her next UTXO worth fifty (50)…and makes that
a second input for the transaction.</p>
<p>The transaction now currently has two inputs, one worth one hundred
(100) and one worth fifty (50), and one output worth one hundred and one
(101) to me.</p>
<p>What about the remaining 49 bitcoins that were originally
Gloria’s?</p>
<p>Where do those go?</p>
<p>To make sure that Gloria can spend these bitcoins at a later date,
she makes a second output to herself known as a change UTXO, or another
piggy bank, containing all the remaining unspent bitcoins from the
inputs.</p>
<p>This way, she can give one hundred and one (101) of her one hundred
and fifty (150) bitcoins to me and keep her remaining forty nine (49)
even though she doesn’t have UTXOs which sum up to exactly the amount
she wants to spend.</p>
<p>From here, if I’m equally generous and want to give that remaining
amount to Derrick, I can just make my new UTXO an input into a different
transaction…the output of which will be Derrick’s new UTXO.</p>
<p>This is how Bitcoin effectively keeps track of individual
transactions and prevents anyone from spending incorrect amounts of
bitcoin.</p>
<h3 id="intro-record-keeping-stage-3">Intro: Record Keeping (Stage
3)</h3>
<p>We have now understood how to assign unique identities to every user
through public and private keys and conduct transactions between these
entities through the use of the UTXO, or Unspent Transaction Output,
model.</p>
<p>Naturally, the next question to ask is: How do we keep track of the
history of transactions?</p>
<p>After all a user’s current balance can be described as a number of
transactions, summing to the current amount, and if we don’t know what
transactions have happened in the past, we can’t determine what’s valid
in the future.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------  --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image013-recordkeeping-distributed-dbs.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81998in" /></p>
<p>Consider the diagram above.</p>
<p>Let this represent our network, which includes 5 entities.</p>
<p>Each of these circles represents an identity: me (Rustie) in green on
top, Gloria in red on the top right, Nick in purple on the bottom right,
Nadir in blue on the bottom left, and Derrick in orange on the top
left.</p>
<p>We are all connected to each other on this network, as is apparent by
the straight edges connecting each circle.</p>
<p>For simplicity’s sake, I’ve replaced all public keys with names.</p>
<p>I’ve also replaced the UTXO model with a basic table on the top right
hand side of the screen.</p>
<p>We need to store the history of transactions for obvious reasons: to
know who owns what in the present, and to use this history to confirm
the validity of future transactions.</p>
<p>To save this information, we need some form of database.</p>
<p>A database is a store of information, and there are many types and
implementations of databases.</p>
<p>To understand which type of database we need to use in Bitcoin, let’s
recall again the requirements of the Bitcoin protocol: we want no
central entity in control of the information in the network, and we want
a way for anyone to be able to read and write to the history of
transactions.</p>
<p>Hence, we want to use a distributed database: as its name entails,
information stored in a distributed manner, meaning that the information
is not stored by one entity or only in one location.</p>
<p>Because Bitcoin aims to be decentralized, we want to use exactly
that.</p>
<p>What does this distributed database look like, and where exactly is
it stored?</p>
<p>There’s no central entity to hold on to our information, so the
closest thing is having a chosen set of entities hold onto this
history.</p>
<p>If we assigned several entities in the network the responsibility of
maintaining and sharing our ledger of transactions, we are still seeing
some parts of centralization sneak their way into our protocol because
we would have to trust the maintainers of this distributed database,
going against Bitcoin’s aim to be a trustless system.</p>
<p>We must find another way.</p>
<p>Instead of having any selected maintainers, let’s make a simple and
straightforward choice: we have everyone keep a copy of the ledger.</p>
<p>We make everyone the bank.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------  --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image014-recordkeeping-everyones-the-bank.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81998in" /></p>
<p>To get as far as possible from centralization, every individual
entity in Bitcoin should be equal.</p>
<p>If every person stores the ledger, then every person has just as much
right and legitimacy as the next person to vote on the validity of
transactions.</p>
<p>Every person has control of their own data, and no person can decide
for anyone else.</p>
<p>There’s no one person to bribe, no one person to hack, no one person
to cheat in order to alter the database.</p>
<p>This is the maximum state of individual independence possible for
maintaining this history of transactions.</p>
<p>We know that we want each person to store the ledger, but what should
the database actually look like?</p>
<p>What data structures hold the transaction history?</p>
<p>We might naively decide to store every transaction individually, but
for a network that may be dealing with many transactions per second,
updating the database for every received transaction will be costly,
especially since this update would have to be delivered to everyone in
the network.</p>
<p>Everyone maintains their own ledger after all, and once a change is
made for one entity, it must propagate throughout the entire
network.</p>
<p>How do we store our ledger efficiently?</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------  --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image015-recordkeeping-the-blockchain.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81998in" /></p>
<p>Every update to the distributed database, the Bitcoin ledger, is a
batch of transactions grouped into what are called blocks.</p>
<p>Every block is built off, or chained to, a previous block.</p>
<p>Altogether, this forms a magical data structure known as a
“blockchain.”</p>
<p>By grouping data into blocks, we do not have to strain the network as
a result of updating every ledger after every transaction.</p>
<p>With a blockchain, only every block, which may contain thousands of
transactions, needs to be appended to the blockchain.</p>
<p>In this way, blockchains efficiently keep track of not only the
transactions in any given update but also give the database discrete
states.</p>
<p>Every block is an update, and a chain of blocks represents a
history.</p>
<p>This process is helpful for identifying discrepancies between two
different versions of the database, since it is clearer what happened in
the ledger at any given time than if every transaction were individually
processed.</p>
<p>Every block contains information about the previous block, as every
block is built off the previous one.</p>
<p>If any block is mutated, intentionally or not, information within
this block and all future blocks will change.</p>
<p>This makes the blockchain tamper-evident, as tampering with a
transaction from the past would invalidate any future blocks linking
back to it.</p>
<p>To reiterate, this design choice is both to reduce the strain of
storing individual transactions and to facilitate consistency between
all members of the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>Of course, the next question is, “How does everyone come to agreement
on the next block?”</p>
<p>We will go over this in the next segment on consensus.</p>
<h3 id="intro-consensus-stage-4">Intro: Consensus (Stage 4)</h3>
<p>Now we know how to send transactions to one another with unique
identities using the UTXO model, and how to store these transactions
using a blockchain to maintain a global record.</p>
<p>At this point, we’re only missing one final piece to bring all these
different components together.</p>
<p>How do we make updates to the blockchain?</p>
<p>How do we decide which transactions, or blocks of transactions, are
valid?</p>
<p>With no central entity deciding on the next update, we have to find a
way to make this decision in a decentralized way.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, users on the network must come to consensus, or
agreement, on the next valid update.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- Consensus: Staying On the Same Page ------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image016-consensus-staying-on-the-same-page.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81998in" /></p>
<p>Because everyone is storing information about the blockchain, we need
consensus to make sure that everyone agrees on the history of
transactions.</p>
<p>Not only do all users need to agree on the update, but they also need
to agree on a valid update to make sure that no corrupted information is
accepted by the network.</p>
<p>If there was no way for different parties to come to agreement on
this, then there will forever be this schism between them.</p>
<p>Without agreement, we cannot have a functioning distributed
database.</p>
<p>We have to all stay on the same page to make sure that we all believe
in the same reality of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Thus, it is imperative that we have a mechanism by which everyone can
come to consensus.</p>
<p>To understand the best consensus mechanism for Bitcoin, we will start
off by understanding what problems exist with naive consensus strategies
and solve them in the next iteration, continuing this process until we
finally recreate Bitcoin’s consensus model.</p>
<p>For this consensus buildup, we will consider the same 5 actors from
before: me (Rustie), Gloria, Derrick, Nadir, and Nick.</p>
<p>In the most basic consensus mechanism, updates take the following
form:</p>
<p>One node proposes a transaction to the network, sending a message
about the transaction directly to every other node.</p>
<p>All other nodes save the transaction into their history if it’s valid
and disregard it otherwise.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------- ?? Consensus: Double Spend Attack --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image017-consensus-double-spend-attack.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81998in" /></p>
<p>We have an example for you here.</p>
<p>Gloria wants to make a transaction to Nadir, so she sends that
message to all four other entities.</p>
<p>This is represented by the arrows pointing from Gloria to every other
entity, blue to represent that she is making a transaction to Nadir, the
blue circle.</p>
<p>The implication of this system is that nodes don’t engage in
conversation with one another, and the only nodes that see a transaction
with one hundred (100) percent certainty are the sender and
recipient.</p>
<p>As we will see, this does not work because of what’s known as the
double spend attack.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- Consensus: Double Spend Attack 2 ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image018-consensus-double-spend-attack-2.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81998in" /></p>
<p>With centralized systems, we trust banks to check for the validity of
all the transactions.</p>
<p>Recall that one condition of a transaction being valid is that
proposed funds for the transaction are not promised elsewhere in a
previous transaction.</p>
<p>Because we do not have a bank to check if there is any malicious
behavior, we must build mechanisms that handle these situations.</p>
<p>Let’s say that Gloria is purchasing tons of laptops and is willing to
pay both Nadir and myself (Rustie) 10 bitcoins for our laptops.</p>
<p>Gloria promises me (Rustie) 10 BTC in one transaction, and promises
10 BTC to Nadir at the same time.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------- 18. Consensus: Double Spend Attack 2 -------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image018-consensus-double-spend-attack-2.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81998in" /></p>
<p>This is represented by the green arrow from herself to me (Rustie),
the green circle, and by the separate blue arrow from herself to Nadir,
the blue circle.</p>
<p>However, she only has 10 BTC in total.</p>
<p>Her invalid transaction evades detection because, as you may have
realized, she only tells one person about each transaction: the person
receiving the bitcoins.</p>
<p>I (Rustie) only know about my (Rustie’s) incoming bitcoins, and Nadir
only knows about his.</p>
<p>Derrick and Nick, the other entities in the network, know nothing
about either transaction.</p>
<p>This is what’s known as a double spend attack.</p>
<p>Gloria is spending only 10 bitcoins to get 20 bitcoins worth of
goods.</p>
<p>In this naive version of consensus, this is legal: with her
transaction to me, Gloria tells me to update my copy of the ledger, and
with her transaction to Nadir, she tells Nadir to update his copy of the
ledger.</p>
<p>Both Nadir and I see that the transaction is valid and each believe
that we have received the bitcoins.</p>
<p>Of course, both Nadir and I (Rustie) can’t own the same bitcoins.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!--------------------- 19. Consensus: Double Spend Attack Malicious ----------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image019-consensus-double-spend-attack-malicious.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81998in" /></p>
<p>The moment we try to redeem these tokens with the network, the issue
becomes transparent.</p>
<p>It’s going to look to Derrick and Nick that these transactions never
happened.</p>
<p>If I try to convince anyone else that I (Rustie) own these ten
bitcoins, they’ll all think I’m crazy because they’ve seen no evidence
of me (Rustie) ever having received these bitcoins.</p>
<p>The same applies to Nadir.</p>
<p>In this scheme where entities only see the transactions that directly
involve them as sender or recipient, it is impossible to come to
consensus on a history of transactions because of dishonest actors.</p>
<p>Thus, it is impossible to prevent these double spend attacks with our
current model of consensus.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------------- Consensus: Peer Validation ------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image020-consensus-peer-validation.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81998in" /></p>
<p>Instead of individuals doing their own validation of transaction, we
can set up a voting system.</p>
<p>The problem with our previous version of consensus was that there
wasn’t any consensus!</p>
<p>Instead of making siloed decisions as we did before, let’s implement
a system of proposers and voters.</p>
<p>One person at a time makes a proposal about an update, and everyone
else votes on whether or not to accept the proposal.</p>
<p>The person who wants to make a transaction sends the transaction to
everyone in the entire network, not just the recipient of bitcoins.</p>
<p>Everyone on the network then casts votes based on whether the
transaction they saw was valid or not.</p>
<p>Only after receiving a certain number of votes, say a majority, does
the transaction get saved.</p>
<p>Like before, there are blue lines from Gloria to the rest of the
network to indicate that she is making a transaction to Nadir.</p>
<p>Unlike before, there are dashed blue lines from each node to everyone
else (excluding Gloria) as an indication of communication about two
things: the received transaction and a vote for or against its
validity.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- 21. Consensus: Reject Double Spend -------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image021-consensus-reject-double-spend.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81998in" /></p>
<p>Let’s observe what happens when Gloria tries to double spend under
these circumstances.</p>
<p>Now, when Gloria attempts to double spend, she will be rejected by
observing peers.</p>
<p>She again sends only two messages: One of a transaction to me
(Rustie), as indicated with the solid green arrow, and one to Nadir, as
indicated with the solid blue arrow.</p>
<p>However, we introduce a new component: communication.</p>
<p>The dashed blue and green lines from Nadir and myself (Rustie)
respectively represent the relay of those message to the rest of the
network.</p>
<p>By looking to the rest of the network for input, considering everyone
else the third party, we are protected against Gloria’s attempts at
malicious behavior.</p>

<p>Peers in the network vote “no” on Gloria’s proposal, as they notice
multiple transactions trying to spend the same funds.</p>
<p>The transaction doesn’t go through, and is not included in an update
to the blockchain.</p>
<p>It looks like we’ve solved all our problems: we have a voting system
that ensures that no one can double spend the same funds, and each peer
stores the whole history of transactions so that they can verify for
themselves that the funds exist.</p>
<p>It looks as if we are victorious!</p>
<p>However, we forgot one fatal truth about Bitcoin: the anonymity.</p>

<p>Recall that Bitcoin is an accessible, anonymous network with no
central registry.</p>
<p>Banks keep track of everyone’s identities and accounts, but no such
infrastructure is available in Bitcoin to prevent anyone from producing
multiple identities.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, anyone can join, and anyone can participate.</p>
<p>Because of the ease with which Bitcoin addresses can be generated,
nothing is stopping Gloria from generating more identities and posing as
Derrick and Nick.</p>
<p>It’s inexpensive to create multiple identities, requiring only the
generation of a random number, as seen in the identity section.</p>
<p>Because of this low cost, Gloria can easily hold multiple Bitcoin
identities to cast more votes than she should be allowed.</p>
<p>Gloria, a real-world minority, could easily propose and vote for her
own malicious transactions by creating sufficient identities and
occupying a network majority.</p>
<p>In other words, this current version of consensus is susceptible to a
Sybil attack, where a user creates multiple identities for some
malicious purpose.</p>
<p>With such a little cost to vote, votes become meaningless.</p>
<p>There’s no value in a vote because anyone with spare time can make as
many identities as they want.</p>
<p>We see that this is a problem when Gloria attempts the Double Spend
attack because, with these extra identities under her control, she
succeeds.</p>
<p>She sends the transactions to Nadir and me (Rustie), and we send
these transactions to the rest of the network, and they all vote that
both transactions are valid.</p>
<p>Because the majority votes on both transactions being valid, we now
have a lack of consensus about what the truth is.</p>
<p>Gloria has broken Bitcoin all because it was easy for her to pose as
multiple people and cast multiple votes, overwhelming Nadir and myself
(Rustie).</p>
<p>Clearly, to solve the problem, we cannot assume that each online
identity deserves the same voting power, as some people have multiple
identities.</p>
<p>To ensure that every real person only has one vote, we have to make a
vote expensive.</p>
<p>We have to make it such that anyone trying to vote has the same
amount of voting power as anyone else, regardless of how many Bitcoin
identities they have.</p>
<p>But how?</p>
<p>Is it even possible to solve this problem?</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------------- 24. Consensus: Pay to Play ------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image024-consensus-pay-to-play.png" 
  alt="Consensus: Pay to Play"
  style="width:5in;height:2.81998in" /></p>
<p>This is where the innovation of Satoshi Nakamoto comes into play.</p>
<p>They recognized that in order to ensure every real entity has equal
voting power, they cannot vote with identities at all.</p>
<p>Instead, Satoshi realized that, to preserve freedom and anonymity
while solving the issue of endless identities, each vote must be cast
with resources.</p>
<p>Scarce, valuable, tangible assets.</p>
<p>The particular resource that Satoshi identified was one available to
all users of Bitcoin:</p>
<p>computing power!</p>
<p>Online entities can be generated easily, but you can’t copy-paste a
computer.</p>
<p>By tethering voting power to scarce computing power, Satoshi ensured
that all users have scarce voting power.</p>
<p>In his whitepaper, he envisioned a “1-CPU-1-vote” network, rather
than the traditional “1-identity-1-vote” system.</p>
<p>It is this new concept of voting with resources instead of with
identities that earned the title “Nakamoto Consensus.”</p>
<p>The particular consensus algorithm that Satoshi Nakamoto came up with
is known as “Proof-of-Work.”</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------ 25. Consensus: Proof of Work ------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image025-consensus-proof-of-work.png" 
  alt="Consensus: Proof of Work"
  style="width:5in;height:2.81998in" /></p>
<p>Let’s break down the word “Proof-of-Work.”</p>
<p>We know “proof” to mean “evidence,” and “work” to mean “spent
resources.”</p>
<p>In other words, “Proof-of-Work” is the method by which users provide
evidence of spending resources.</p>
<p>It is the method by which computing power is translated into voting
power.</p>
<p>It is the method by which users vote in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>It is this method of voting that made Bitcoin the first successful
cryptocurrency and inspired voting mechanisms for practically every
other cryptocurrency to follow.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- 26. Consensus: Proof of Work: Works -------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image026-consensus-proof-of-work-works.png" 
    alt="Consensus: Proof of Work: Works"
    style="width:5in;height:2.81998in" /></p>
<p>Here’s how Proof-of-Work works: whenever someone wants to make a
proposal to the rest of the Bitcoin network, they first have to solve a
computationally difficult problem.</p>
<p>In other words, their computer is tasked with a problem that can only
be solved by doing a significant amount of work.</p>
<p>This problem is uniquely generated based on the information within
the proposed block and cannot be predicted beforehand.</p>
<p>There’s no way to predict the solution to the problem.</p>
<p>Instead, it’s similar to brute forcing a password: all you can do is
trial and error.</p>
<p>Your computer will try a bunch of inputs until it finds a solution to
the problem, at which point it will submit the successful input along
with the proposed block to the rest of the network.</p>
<p>The unpredictability of the form of correct inputs ensures that
there’s no way to “game the system,” keeping any user from cheating.</p>
<p>By having every user solve a brute force problem, you have a
reasonable expectation that they’ve done a lot of work to solve it.</p>
<p>You might ask, “What if a user gets lucky and finds the solution to
this brute force problem on the first try?”</p>
<p>Well, this is possible, but not probable.</p>
<p>For example, it’s possible for me to guess the PIN on your phone in
one try – but it’s because we believe in the unlikeliness of that
situation that we aren’t afraid of anyone breaking into our phones.</p>
<p>Although we can’t guarantee that it takes exactly some amount of
computation to solve these problems, we have reasonable expectations
based on how long on average it takes to solve these problems.</p>
<p>Let’s see Proof-of-Work in action.</p>
<p>Again, Gloria tries to double spend on Nadir and me (Rustie), and
these two transactions are sent to the rest of the network.</p>
<p>We all vote on the transactions, but Gloria no longer has a voting
advantage even though she still has control of two extra Bitcoin
identities.</p>
<p>Her voting power is bound by her computer, just as everyone else’s
is.</p>
<p>Even though there are five digital identities, there are only three
real-world identities.</p>
<p>Under Proof-of-Work, no matter how many digital identities are
formed, there will only ever be three voting entities.</p>
<p>Because Nadir and I (Rustie) recognize that there are two
transactions trying to spend the same funds, we can vote against both
transactions being included in the blockchain.</p>
<p>Gloria with her single computer is incapable of outvoting us, which
is precisely what we want!</p>
<p>By tying our voting power to our real-world identities through the
scarce resource of computing power, we have successfully eliminated
Sybil attacks from Bitcoin and solved the double spending problem.</p>
<p>This is what made Bitcoin a revolutionary technology.</p>

<h3 id="supplement-51-attacks">Supplement: 51% Attacks</h3>
<p>The Bitcoin network requires Proof-of-Work to add new blocks to the
blockchain. Users in the Bitcoin network vote on new blocks, and come to
consensus on whether or not new blocks should be included in the
blockchain. Proof-of-Work ties voting power to computational power
rather than digital identity, and was designed to prevent the Sybil
attack, where a malicious actor creates many identities to skew the
vote. However, due to an uneven distribution of computational power,
Satoshi Nakamoto’s “1 CPU 1 Vote” vision is not reflected perfectly in
reality.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s correct operation hinges on one key assumption: that there
is an honest majority of computational power. An honest majority would
be able to mine faster than a malicious minority, and thus have a higher
probability of creating the next block. Once the network comes to
consensus on these new blocks, generally it is in a miner’s best
interest to follow protocol and mine on the longest observed blockchain.
The longest chain is seen as the “true” valid transaction history
because it has had the most work put into it. Therefore, the majority
defines the transaction history.</p>
<p>However, if a malicious entity controls more than 50% of the mining
power (say 51%), it has the majority and is now able to mine an
alternative chain (with a different transaction history) and make it the
longest chain. Bitcoin users would then accept that chain as the “true”
transaction history. This happens for the same reasons that an honest
majority might be able to maintain the longest chain. Giving power to
the majority is a requirement of the decentralization Bitcoin aims to
achieve. If we allow an honest minority to control the transaction
history, then we’ve created a centralized entity consisting of the
collection of these honest actors and thus defeated the purpose of
decentralization. </p>
<p>With 51% of the mining power, malicious actors can double spend, and
use the same bitcoins for two different transactions. A malicious actor
may send the same bitcoin to a third party and then to itself, choosing
to include and validate the latter transaction and avoiding payment
altogether. </p>
<p>One entity holding majority mining power also makes the network
susceptible to the Goldfinger Attack, where a 51% is used to destroy the
value of a cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>We’ll explore all these attacks in further detail in future course
modules.</p>
<h3 id="forking">Forking</h3>
<p>Sometimes, different miners may create different blocks, either
intentionally (e.g. double spending) or unintentionally, to add at the
same point on the blockchain. This creates multiple chains: multiple
different versions of the transaction history. We say that the blocks
are competing at the same block height, and that there has been a fork.
Following protocol, miners eventually resolve the fork and agree upon
one of the chains to be the valid blockchain, and continue to build
blocks upon it. </p>
<p>While some forks occur naturally, and some are the result of double
spending attempts, there also exist purposeful cases of forking, used to
make changes to the Bitcoin protocol. </p>
<p>Two categories of these protocol changes are soft and hard forks.
Soft forks implement protocol updates that strictly reduces the set of
valid transactions, while hard forks, conversely, allow for previously
invalid transactions to become valid.</p>
<p>We’ll explain more in the course modules for Module 4.</p>

    alt="Key Takeaway - Identity: Your Keys are Your Identity"
    style="width:5in;height:2.80395in" /></p>
<p>Let’s go over what we talked about in lecture.</p>
<p>First, we talked about the concept of identity on the Bitcoin
network.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, each node’s identity is represented by their public
key.</p>
<p>However, ultimately the public keys are controlled by the owner of
private keys.</p>
<p>Only the private key can be used to spend money.</p>
<p>Another thing to note about identity is that users can generate as
many private/public key pairs as they want.</p>
<p>How does it work again?</p>
<p>Remember that there are 2 to the 160 total possible private keys.</p>
<p>It is extremely unlikely that someone might happen to generate the
same private key as yours.</p>
<p>Nor is it at all likely that someone can guess your private key to
spend money on your behalf.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

    alt="Key Takeaway - Transactions: Breaking the Piggy Banks"
    style="width:5in;height:2.80395in" /></p>
<p>Bitcoin doesn’t have the account balance model that banks have.</p>
<p>Instead, users spend outputs from previous transactions.</p>
<p>These specific outputs are called “Unspent Transaction Outputs” or
UTXO.</p>
<p>The total value of bitcoins you have is the sum of all of UTXOs you
own.</p>
<p>These UTXOs are uniquely identifiable and make tracking payments at
the protocol level much more straightforward: The UTXO record system
makes it easy for nodes to see how funds change hands between users and
UTXOs.</p>
<p>The UTXO model might not be the most intuitive model for us to
understand, but it works well for bitcoin from an architectural
standpoint.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------- 29. Key Takeaway - Record-Keeping: Everyone's the Bank -------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image029-key-takeaway-record-keeping.png" 
    alt="Key Takeaway - Record-Keeping: Everyone's the Banks"
    style="width:5in;height:2.80395in" /></p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, the blockchain is the key data structure for
recording Bitcoin activity.</p>
<p>New transactions are recorded within new blocks added to the
existing, established chain.</p>
<p>Once a transaction is recorded, it is close to impossible to undo
without changing every single version of this database in the
universe.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------- 30. Key Takeaway - Consensus: Updating the Shared, Immutable Ledger -------------->

<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image030-key-takeaway-consensus.png" 
    alt="Key Takeaway - Consensus: Updating the Shared, Immutable Ledger"
    style="width:5in;height:2.80395in" /></p>
<p>The way that the network reaches consensus is through
Proof-of-Work.</p>
<p>How does it work again?</p>
<p>Proof-of-Work requires that voters expense a considerable amount of
computational power in order to validate transactions.</p>
<p>But why do we need Proof-of-Work?</p>
<p>Because, again, there is no central authority to make sure that one
person only vote once, and there is no limitation on how many identities
one person can generate, Bitcoin uses computational power as a resource
constraint to limit the voting power of malicious entities.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Work hence aims to make votes expensive for everyone, so
that the voting power one has is based on how much computational power
one has, instead of based on the number of identities.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------- 31. Unique Properties of Bitcoin: Demystifying the Buzzwords ------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image031-unique-properties-of-bitcoin.png" 
    alt="Unique Properties of Bitcoin: Demystifying the Buzzwords"
    style="width:5in;height:2.80395in" /></p>
<p>Given all this information, you can now justify many of the common
buzzwords associated with Bitcoin which you may have heard.</p>
<p>The most common descriptors of Bitcoin are “pseudonymous,”
“decentralized”, “immutable”, and “trustless”.</p>
<p>Pseudonymity is a combination of the words “pseudo,” meaning fake,
and “anonymous,” meaning unknown.</p>
<p>Bitcoin attempts to be anonymous through having every user represent
themselves with a random number, the public key.</p>
<p>However, because it is not impossible to trace back these virtual
identities to real world identities, bitcoin is not complete anonymity —
it is only mimicking anonymity.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, addresses and pseudonyms are synonyms – it’s a fake name,
but it can still be used to trace back to you associated with you with
enough effort.</p>
<p>In addition, decentralization refers to taking an activity that is
typically performed by one central entity and repeating the storage of
information and computation among more than one party.</p>
<p>Bitcoin achieves decentralization by having every single participant
in the Bitcoin network store the full history of transactions, as we’ve
seen.</p>
<p>This way, every user possesses a copy of the transaction history and
does not have to ask anyone else for that information.</p>
<p>Immutability, referring to the inability to change information, is
another property of Bitcoin achieved through decentralization.</p>
<p>Once all users in the Bitcoin network decide on the validity of some
transaction, it is extremely difficult for anyone, including themselves,
to undo their decision.</p>
<p>This feature helps foster trust among nodes on the network.</p>
<p>If one wanted to alter the history of transactions, they would have
to change every single user’s local history simultaneously, which in the
present day is close to ten thousand different users.</p>
<p>As a result of these three properties of pseudonymity,
decentralization, and immutability, we achieve in Bitcoin a trustless
network.</p>
<p>Because every user is by default a stranger to everyone else, one may
ask, “How do we trust others in the network?</p>
<p>If we do not trust a majority of Bitcoin users, how do we trust
Bitcoin?”</p>
<p>The Bitcoin protocol ensures that one does not need to trust their
peers in order to be certain that any transaction they make will be
accurately recorded by the rest of the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>First, the ledger is publicly verifiable.</p>
<p>Anyone can see any and all information about the history of
transactions in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>You can go to the blockchain and check if your transaction has gone
through.</p>
<p>In addition, the Bitcoin network is secured through the Proof-of-Work
consensus protocol designed by Satoshi Nakamoto which changed the way
everyone thinks about cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>These are the four essential unique properties of Bitcoin:
pseudonymous, decentralized, immutable, and trustless.</p>

<h3 id="lecturemodule-1-summary">Lecture/Module 1 Summary:</h3>
<h3 id="i.-what-is-bitcoin">I. What is Bitcoin?</h3>
<p>Cryptocurrency is a completely digital, formless currency, tied
together using computer science, cryptography and economics. Bitcoin is
the first and most widely used cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is inspired by the Cypherpunk Movement in the 1980s, which
advocated for protection of privacy from external entities using
cryptography. Satoshi Nakamoto first outlined and created Bitcoin in
2008 and 2009.</p>
<p>Bitcoin aims to be pseudonymous, trustless, decentralized, and
immutable. In addition, anyone with a computer and internet connection
can join the Bitcoin network. Each computer is a node in the Bitcoin
network, and each node may verify and audit the transaction history of
their own funds. In Bitcoin, the minting and distribution of bitcoins is
determined through mining; since anyone can mine and win bitcoins, this
process also aims to be decentralized.</p>
<p>Some of the challenges Bitcoin addresses are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The difficulty to ensure every Bitcoin node holds a consistent
version of the transaction history</p></li>
<li><p>The difficulty to identify malicious actors</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These conditions may normally allow a node to conduct a Double Spend
Attack, in which the one spends the same funds more than once by
tricking parts of the network to believe different versions of the
transaction history. However, Satoshi overcame this problem using
blockchain and Proof-of-Work. </p>
<p>Bitcoin is robust because it serves the same functions as a bank:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Account management; the Bitcoin protocol gives users a way to
create and manage their own identities (account)</p></li>
<li><p>Legitimacy; It ensures we are legitimate owners and accessors of
our accounts</p></li>
<li><p>Record-keeping; It honestly records account balances at each
transaction.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike a bank, Bitcoin is decentralized and ensures a high degree of
privacy and trust. </p>
<p>Trust is built on the blockchain due to a high level of transparency:
blockchain is a publicly verifiable ledger, not owned by any entity, and
it prevents any single point of failure.</p>
<p>To maintain this trust, we need identity in Bitcoin for
authentication and assigning blame. Bitcoin uses public keys to send
funds and private keys to prove ownership of the public key and redeem
the sent funds. Each individual is responsible for creating and managing
their own private and public keys. Public keys are generated from
Private keys and are used to send/receive funds. Private keys are
randomly generated and used to prove ownership of the public key. The
chances of guessing the same private key are very low.</p>
<p>In addition to proof of ownership, in order to be considered valid,
transactions must also have enough available funds to spend from and
guarantee that no other transaction uses the same funds. Bitcoin uses
the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO), in which users spend directly
from transactions made to them.</p>
<p>Instead of storing transactions individually, Bitcoin batches them
into “blocks,” built off of their previous blocks, thus forming the
tamper-evident, blockchain data structure.</p>
<p>Users on the blockchain must come to a consensus on which updates and
blocks to add to the blockchain. Doing so also prevents Double Spend
Attacks. Bitcoin uses a form of peer validation to build a shared
transaction history; everyone on the network casts votes on the validity
of a transaction. To prevent a Sybil Attack, where users create multiple
identities for malicious purposes, Bitcoin employs Proof of Work, where
voting power is based on computational power, to make voting
expensive.</p>

<p>A question we sometimes get from students in our class here at UC
Berkeley is: why use Bitcoin?</p>
<p>After all, we’ve seen that it’s <strong>slow,</strong> it’s
<strong>redundant</strong>, and <strong>inefficient</strong>.</p>
<p>Banks are so much more convenient!</p>
<p>While we’ve mainly been focusing on how Bitcoin works, we’ll be
taking a step back and understanding why Bitcoin is the way it is.</p>
<p>We will examine the cultural, political, and technological influences
that drove the development of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>As we’ll see, Bitcoin didn’t just pop up out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Understanding its historical background and numerous failed
predecessors will give us a deeper understanding of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>From there, we’ll explore the present-day state of the blockchain
space, including various new cryptocurrencies inspired by Bitcoin along
with how blockchain technology has diverged from its origins in
Bitcoin.</p>
<p>This journey will take us from the Cypherpunks, who hated big banks
and championed privacy and power for individuals, to adoption of
blockchain technology by JPMorgan Chase, one of the largest banking
institutions in the United States.</p>
<h3 id="intro-pre-bitcoin">Intro: Pre-Bitcoin</h3>
<p>The roots of Bitcoin start with libertarianism.</p>
<p>Libertarianism is a political ideology which believes that
centralized authority should be as minimal as possible.</p>
<p>Individuals should have as much power as possible to decide the
course of their own lives and shouldn’t have to sacrifice rights or
properties to a government excessively.</p>
<p>You may already see how this ideology relates to Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Amongst increasing centralized state control, especially of services
and of individual information, libertarian dreamers grew concerned with
privacy.</p>
<p>From online discussions on forums and mailing lists, two groups
formed: the Cypherpunks and the Crypto-anarchists, both of which
advocated for the use of cryptography to protect one’s privacy.</p>

<p>Before explaining a bit of the background behind all of this, let’s
look at this quote first:</p>
<p>“Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age.
Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn’t want
the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn’t
want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself
to the world.”</p>
<p>The quote comes from the Cypherpunk Manifesto, which was written by
Eric Hughes, a computer programmer and mathematician from UC
Berkeley.</p>
<p>He’s one of the founders of the Cypherpunk movement, and in the 90s
founded and administered the Cypherpunk mailing list.</p>

<p>The Cypherpunks and Crypto-anarchists hated the idea of national
agencies being able to spy on them and have access to their
information.</p>
<p>They also hated censorship.</p>
<p>But most of all, they hated big banks and governments, both of which
were giant centers of power diminishing the autonomy of the average
citizen.</p>
<p>This dichotomy of power only grew as the technology of these
institutions evolved faster than that of the general public.</p>
<p>In the past, before these technological innovations, cash was pretty
anonymous in purely its physical form.</p>
<p>Once you spend it, there’s no easy way to trace it.</p>
<p>But in an increasingly digital world, the convenience of big banks
tracking account balances and transfers comes with the cost of
privacy.</p>
<p>And so, these libertarians saw early on the need for an anonymous
digital “transaction system” or currency – one that gave users “the
power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.”</p>
<h3 id="bitcoin-precursors">Bitcoin Precursors</h3>
<p>The Cypherpunks didn’t get together, design a cryptocurrency, and
succeed on their first attempt.</p>
<p>Several early attempts at making a true cryptocurrency failed, though
they came close.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------- 34. Early Attampts: Digicash -------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image034-early-attempts-Digicash.png" 
    alt="Early Attampts: Digicash"
    style="width:5in;height:2.80395in" /></p>
<p>These early failures inspired Bitcoin to adopt some key features that
they implemented and learned from their mistakes.</p>
<p>As the existing financial system was one of the greatest threats to
individual privacy, cryptographer David Chaum implemented Digicash using
the latest advancements in public and private key cryptography.</p>
<p>Chaum himself had invented “blind signatures” while studying at UC
Berkeley.</p>
<p>Blind signatures allowed users to sign off on transactions without
revealing their identity.</p>
<p>Digicash promised complete privacy for users conducting online
transactions and included a system of cryptographic protocols that
prevented banks and governments from tracing personal online
payments.</p>
<p>Ironically, however, Digicash failed because of what it feared the
most: centralization.</p>
<p>Digicash was hosted by Chaum’s own company, and if his company ever
went down, Digicash would also go with it.</p>
<p>And that’s exactly what happened.</p>
<p>Chaum’s company DigiCash Inc bore the overwhelming burden of having
to validate each and every digital signature in the DigiCash system,
which eventually led to bankruptcy in 1998.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------- 35. Early Attampts: HashCash -------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image035-early-attempts-hashcash.png" 
    alt="Early Attampts: HashCash"
    style="width:5in;height:2.80395in" /></p>
<p>Hashcash was originally invented as a mechanism to limit email
spam.</p>
<p>In order to send out an email, one would have to solve a
cryptographic hash puzzle and provide a proof of work.</p>
<p>Only after proving that they have expended computational resources –
with a Hashcash stamp added to the email header – can someone send out a
valid email.</p>
<p>Email recipients can then verify emails that they receive are valid,
by looking at the email headers for a valid Hashcash stamp.</p>
<p>The idea is that spammers wouldn’t be able to spam emails
anymore.</p>
<p>It would be too costly, as spammers goals are to send out huge
numbers of emails with little cost per message.</p>
<p>So, by making it computationally expensive to send out email,
hashcash disincentivized spammers.</p>

    alt="Early Attampts: B-Money"
    style="width:5in;height:2.80395in" /></p>
<p>B-money was an early proposal for a cryptocurrency created by Wei
Dai.</p>
<p>In 1998, Dai published a paper titled “B-money, an anonymous,
distributed electronic cash system,” and laid out some core concepts
that would later be used to implement Bitcoin and other
cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Among B-money’s core concepts were that:</p>
<p>A proof of work function like Hashcash is used as a means of creating
money.</p>
<p>Everyone maintains a copy of the database showing who owns what, and
work is verified by the community, who all work to update a collective
ledger.</p>
<p>And transactions are accomplished by collective bookkeeping and
authenticated with cryptographic hashes.</p>
<p>Workers are awarded funds for their efforts in creating money through
expending computational resources.</p>
<p>Contracts and transactions are enforced through the broadcast and
signing of transactions with digital signatures.</p>
<p>These ideas from B-money would later influence the development and
design philosophy of Bitcoin.</p>

<!------------------ 37. Satoshi Nakamoto: Oct, 2008 Bitcoin Whitepaper -------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image037-satoshi-nakamoto.png”
alt=“Satoshi Nakamoto: Oct, 2008 Bitcoin Whitepaper”&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In October 2008, a whitepaper was published online, titled, “Bitcoin:
A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.”</p>
<p>This 9 page whitepaper outlined the design and justification for a
digital currency, or cryptocurrency, controlled by no single entity.</p>
<p>Traditionally, we trust the singular bank to conduct financial
services on our behalf.</p>
<p>With Bitcoin, the intention is to do what no other attempt at a
cryptocurrency could do before: create an anonymous, trustless,
decentralized currency.</p>
<p>Instead of trusting any individual humans, we put trust into math,
cryptography, and logic.</p>
<p>We trust the Bitcoin protocol, even if we don’t trust any individual
in the network.</p>
<p>This cryptocurrency relies on computational power to cast votes.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, this is known as Proof-of-Work.</p>
<p>And as we saw earlier, the idea of solving a cryptographic hash
puzzle was also used in Hashcash.</p>
<p>Satoshi wrote in the whitepaper that this is meant to enforce a
“one-CPU-one-vote” system, such that every computer only has the ability
to cast one vote in the consensus process.</p>
<p>This is different from the traditional “one-identity-one-vote”
process used in government elections because we can’t assume that each
real world identity has only one digital identity.</p>
<p>In addition, each person maintains their own identity through public
and private keys, authenticating themselves through blind signatures,
which was introduced by David Chaum from DigiCash.</p>
<p>This ensures that every user maintains their own privacy until they
voluntarily choose to reveal themselves.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, every full node maintains their own copy of the
blockchain, similar to how in B-Money’s protocol, every participant
maintains their own individual database, to keep track of how much money
belongs to each user.</p>
<p>Bitcoin was designed to be a deflationary currency, meaning that
there will only be a limited amount of bitcoins that will ever exist,
specifically <strong>21 million</strong>.</p>
<p>Every miner gets a block reward for finding a block, but this block
reward decreases over time.</p>
<p>It began at 50 bitcoins and is halved every (two hundred and ten
thousand) 210,000 blocks.</p>
<p>Eventually, the block reward will become 0, at which point 21 million
bitcoins will have been minted.</p>

src=“/images/image038-bitcoin-the-first-cryptocurrency.png”
alt=“Bitcoin: The First Cryptocurrency”&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Interestingly enough, Satoshi chose to include a message within the
first block of the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p>This information is a powerful glimpse into the mentality and
motivations of Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
<p>As we’ll discuss further in the next module, the coinbase transaction
gives a miner a block reward.</p>
<p>This particular transaction has empty space into which extra
information can be included.</p>
<p>Satoshi chose to reference a story in the Times of London mentioning
a Chancellor bailing out a bank.</p>
<p>As we can tell from several posts and comments made by Satoshi, he
was not fond of the modern banking system, particularly
fractional-reserve banking.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s design aims to eliminate these issues.</p>
<p>During this first year, people sent bitcoins to each other out of
interest, playing around with the software.</p>
<p>During this time, however, bitcoins were never exchanged for any
tangible good.</p>

<p>…in it, a man named Laszlo Hanyecz asked for pizza in exchange of
10,000 bitcoins.</p>
<p>And on May 22, 2010, he received a $25 order of pizza in exchange for
his bitcoins.</p>
<p>This was the world’s first ever Bitcoin transaction for a tangible
asset.</p>
<p>In this moment, Bitcoin went from worthless internet money to
something with real value.</p>
<p>As a fun fact: as of March 15, 2018, the pizzas Laszlo ordered are
now worth 81 million dollars.</p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And here’s Laszlo reporting back on the forum about the pizza’s safe
delivery.</p>
<p>Most people ridicule Laszlo for spending bitcoins on such a small
purchase.</p>
<p>However, they are not aware that Laszlo wanted to see Bitcoin
flourish.</p>
<p>Before this purchase, the idea that bitcoins could be used to
purchase real world goods was ridiculous.</p>
<p>For most people, mining Bitcoin was merely a hobby.</p>
<p>This purchase validated the use of Bitcoin for its original purpose
as a currency actually used for buying goods.</p>
<p>In a way, by trailblazing the currency’s use, Laszlo is a hero to
Bitcoin enthusiasts.</p>
<p>This was the very first time a Bitcoin transaction traded “magic
worthless internet money” for a tangible item of value - therefore
bitcoins have value.</p>
<p>However, it’s not like bitcoins were worth that much when Laszlo
spent them on pizza.</p>
<h1 id="lecturemodule-2">Lecture/Module 2:</h1>
<p>It took years of development and spread before Bitcoin became
accepted as a legitimate technology, yet it’s still got a way to go
before reaching worldwide legitimacy.</p>
<h3 id="intro-early-bitcoin">Intro: Early Bitcoin</h3>
<p>As Bitcoin started to gain popularity, it quickly picked up a bad
reputation due to its focus on privacy and decentralized nature.</p>
<p>Regarding privacy, the difficulty to tie digital identities to the
real world user posed issues in some situations.</p>
<p>On top of that, because Bitcoin is decentralized, there is no central
entity or court to fix any mistakes within the blockchain.</p>
<p>If someone found your private key and stole your funds, no one else
can give your stolen funds back to you.</p>
<p>Early Bitcoin was thus often the target of scandals, hacks, and
illegal activity.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3 id="hacks-and-scandals">Hacks and Scandals</h3>
<p>In the early stages of Bitcoin, there existed no exchange for trading
between bitcoins and regular currencies.</p>
<p>In 2010, Jed McCaleb, turned his domain mtgox.com into a Bitcoin
exchange website.</p>
<p>What was originally the Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange, where
players of the online game Magic the Gathering Online traded cards like
stocks, quickly became one of the largest bitcoin exchanges during the
early stages of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Keep in mind an issue with this exchange: it’s a central point of
failure, and its popularity drew a lot of negative attention.</p>
<p>On June 19, 2011, it was discovered that a hacker was using a Mt. Gox
auditor’s computer to siphon an abundance of bitcoins to themselves.</p>
<p>Mt. Gox was subsequently shut down for seven days to investigate the
situation.</p>
<p>It received several lawsuits, some of which are still being
disputed.</p>
<p>Despite this breach of security, people kept on using Mt. Gox.</p>
<p>For a while, it seemed like all was well.</p>
<p>By 2014, Mt. Gox was handling up to 70% of all Bitcoin transactions –
way too much for what the infrastructure could handle.</p>
<p>In February 2014, Mt. Gox announced that it had lost 744,408 of its
customers bitcoins in an ongoing theft that had gone unnoticed for
years.</p>
<p>By the end of the month, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy.</p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the depths of the dark web, Bitcoin was also used to
purchase drugs.</p>
<p>In February 2011, the website Silk Road opened, quickly earning the
reputation of the anonymous “eBay of Drugs.”</p>
<p>It was led by a man named Ross Ulbricht.</p>
<p>Silk Road leveraged Tor, an anonymous networking protocol, and
handled transactions using Bitcoin.</p>
<p>This combination made it difficult for users’ online identities to be
linked back to their real life identities.</p>
<p>Because of this, drugs and the black market became the primary use
case that came to mind when anyone mentioned Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Even to this day, Bitcoin is tainted with this association.</p>
<p>In October 2013, the FBI shut down Silk Road.</p>
<p>Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to life in jail, and the FBI seized
upwards of 26,000 bitcoins, worth $3.6 million at the time.</p>

<h3 id="bitcoin-bubble-and-altcoins">Bitcoin Bubble and Altcoins</h3>
<p>Between November 1, 2013 and November 30, 2013 – less than a month –
the price of Bitcoin rose from just under $200 to over $1000</p>
<p>In late 2013, the Bitcoin bubble hit its peak at around $1,165 before
suddenly bursting and entering a bearish run that lasted until the end
of 2015.</p>
<p>There are a couple speculations about why the bubble occurred:</p>
<p>First, Chinese investors bought bitcoins as a speculative financial
investment.</p>
<p>Many sold because of warnings issued by the Chinese government</p>
<p>Second, automated trading in Mt. Gox may have artificially driven the
price up by continuously buying bitcoins.</p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Soon after the creation of Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies began
popping up on the internet as well, each tailored to a different use
case or audience.</p>
<p>These cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin – Litecoin, ZCash, Stellar,
Ripple, Ethereum, Dogecoin, DASH, Monero, and others – are known as
altcoins, alt- standing for alternative.</p>
<p>For example, Litecoin aims to be the silver to Bitcoin’s gold.</p>
<p>It is more progressive in its software updates and serves as a
testing ground for proposed Bitcoin software updates.</p>
<p>In addition, ZCash uses innovative zero knowledge proofs, which are a
way to prove a fact without revealing information about the fact
itself.</p>
<p>This furthers cryptocurrency privacy by allowing transactions to be
validated without revealing information about the sender, recipient, and
value transferred.</p>
<p>Stellar and Ripple pioneered new federated consensus algorithms,
eliminating the need to waste electricity solving cryptographic hash
puzzles.</p>
<p>These are just a few examples of how coins other than Bitcoin are
trying to solve their own individual problems, making for a wider crypto
space.</p>

<h3 id="bitcoin-headlines">Bitcoin Headlines</h3>
<p>Following years of hacks and bad reputation, Bitcoin finally began to
grow in general popularity.</p>
<p>Here are some of the big headlines following Mt. Gox’s theft and
subsequent declaration of bankruptcy in February 2014:</p>
<p>In March 2014, people thought they had found Bitcoin inventor Satoshi
Nakamoto in California, but that was a false alarm.</p>
<p>In September 2014, venture capitalist Tim Draper announced his
predictions of Bitcoin’s price heading up to $10,000.</p>
<p>For context about his perspective, he was interested in
cryptocurrencies since before Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In 2003, he met a father in South Korea who bought a virtual sword
for his son with fiat money, and was curious ever since.</p>
<p>He also won some bitcoins from the FBI auction of confiscated
bitcoins from the Silk Road shutdown.</p>
<p>2014 was also the year when merchants began to accept bitcoin as a
form of payment.</p>
<p>In January, Overstock.com became the first major retailer to accept
bitcoins.</p>
<p>Then, in September, PayPal partnered with Coinbase, BitPay, and
GoCoin.</p>
<p>Fun fact: Blockchain at Berkeley was previously known as the Bitcoin
Association of Berkeley, and in 2014, these headlines were happening
every week.</p>
<p>At every club meeting, our 7 members would discuss the latest hack,
the latest bankruptcy, and the latest Ponzi scheme.</p>
<p>We’ve grown so much since then, and that just comes to show how much
the blockchain space has matured over the years.</p>

<p>A bunch of Bitcoin startups began popping up too.</p>
<p>Wallet companies helped other companies or users handle bitcoin
without having to personally join the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>For example, Coinbase is an online exchange that manages wallets and
lets users buy and sell bitcoin for fiat currency.</p>
<p>Bitpay allows merchants to accept bitcoin.</p>
<p>Blockchain.info is a block explorer that allows users to see
individual blocks and transactions in the Bitcoin blockchain in browser,
without having to download the entire blockchain themselves.</p>
<p>Most importantly, during this time, the term “blockchain” started
becoming a buzz word.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>This is a graph of Bitcoin prices from 2014-2015, where you can see
that first prices shot up immensely, then slowly started to fall.</p>
<p>Of course, we all know that the price recovered and went back up
after this, but this was a huge shock to the community at the time.</p>
<p>There are a few theories as to why Bitcoin burst at this time:</p>
<p>One was that investors who had speculated and bought a lot of bitcoin
had second thoughts, and began to sell.</p>
<p>Especially, Chinese investors had sold because of warnings issued by
the Chinese government.</p>
<p>And then of course the market amplified the current trend, so people
further dumped because they feared a loss in value.</p>
<h3 id="intro-scalability">Intro: Scalability</h3>
<p>Historically, Bitcoin has faced a number of challenges as a
technology, including scalability and of course public perception.</p>
<p>Even today, being the first successful and most widely used
decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin still has several problems to
solve before it can be used by the masses.</p>
<p>In this section, we’re going to talk about the next stage of
Bitcoin’s history, when disputes about the core Bitcoin technology
sparked internal debates, and when a separate platform called Ethereum
quickly came to the mainstream.</p>
<h3 id="bitcoin-struggles-to-scale">Bitcoin Struggles to Scale</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------------- image049-bitcoin-struggles-to-scale.png -------------------------------------->

<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%”
src=“/images/image049-bitcoin-struggles-to-scale.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One issue that has been the topic of much debate is that of
scalability.</p>
<p>Scalability refers to the ability of a technology to be used by
increasing numbers of people.</p>
<p>In the context of Bitcoin, it refers to the number of transactions
that the network can confirm in a certain amount of time.</p>
<p>As of March 2018, Bitcoin blocks are created every 10 minutes and can
only hold 1MB of transactions, which is about one to three thousand
transactions per block.</p>
<p>Thus, we can estimate that the Bitcoin blockchain can process about
three transactions a second.</p>
<p>In 2015, the transaction volume exceeded the network’s capacity so
much that blocks actually began to run out of space, meaning that
transactions were left unconfirmed, left without being included in a
block.</p>
<p>This led to proposals like Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, Segregated
Witness (commonly abbreviated as SegWit), and more recently, SegWit2x in
order to improve the network’s transaction processing capacity.</p>
<p>Some of these proposals rely on increasing the block size in order to
fit more transactions, while other ones modify the underlying
protocol.</p>
<p>Each of these solutions have their pros and their cons, but we won’t
discuss them in too much detail right now.</p>
<p>The important thing to understand right now are the questions that
the scalability debate raises about decentralized governance.</p>
<p>For example: what do we do when we want to change Bitcoin?</p>
<p>Governance is the mechanism by which a protocol makes changes to
itself, but no such mechanism was encoded into the Bitcoin protocol.</p>
<p>Instead, users introduce proposals called BIPs, or
<strong><em>Bitcoin Improvement Proposals</em></strong>, outside of the
Bitcoin network, on forums and online discussion boards, and then the
community votes ad hoc on whether or not they want to go through with
that change.</p>
<p>Members can’t directly propose and vote on updates to Bitcoin within
the actual software, but at least the current mechanism gets the job
done.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>After Bitcoin, the next most influential blockchain platform is
Ethereum.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a storage of value, that is to say, it’s
“coin-centric”.</p>
<p>It was created as a medium of payment transaction and a store of
value, an alternative to regular money.</p>
<p>Ethereum, on the other hand, was developed as a platform to execute
peer-to-peer “smart contracts” and applications.</p>
<p>It supports Turing-complete languages, meaning that it can perform
general computation.</p>
<p>In other words, any type of code that I run on a regular computer can
also be run on Ethereum.</p>
<p>Code execution on Ethereum is fueled by Ethereum’s internal token,
called ether.</p>

<p>The platform had a token sale between July and August 2014 and sold
7.4 million ether for 3700 BTC in the first 12 hours of the presale.</p>
<p>At the time, this was equivalent to 2.3 million USD, or in Bugatti
terms, about 1.2 Veyrons.</p>
<p>The Ethereum blockchain officially went live on July 30th 2015, and
by May 2016, the cumulative value of Ethereum tokens was more than $1
billion.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Around that time, the idea of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
(DAOs for short) became hugely popular.</p>
<p>DAOs are essentially programs on the Ethereum blockchain that create
a distributed government.</p>
<p>“TheDAO” was a specific project that would serve as a decentralized
Venture Capital, allowing their investors to vote and decide on the
distribution of funds between startups.</p>
<p>However, in July 2016, these dreams came crashing down when a hacker
exploited a bug in the underlying code, stealing about $120 million
worth of Ether from TheDAO smart contract.</p>
<p>Outraged by the enormous theft, several voices in the community
proposed to defy the protocol and undo the hack.</p>
<p>The majority of community decided to simultaneously rewind their own
chain and ignore all activity starting from the hack, but a small subset
chose not to undo that activity with the belief that “code is law.”</p>
<p>The split that rewinded (zurückgespult) history is the split that is
currently branded as Ethereum.</p>
<p>The remainder that believed that nothing - including catastrophic
events like the DAO Hack – should be reverted stayed on the main chain,
now known as Ethereum Classic.</p>

<h3 id="ethereum-bubble">Ethereum Bubble</h3>
<p>On June 21st 2017, the price of Ethereum on the exchange GDAX crashed
briefly to 10 cents USD per ether due to a massive sell order.</p>
<p>This is a testament to the massive volatility of cryptocurrency
prices.</p>
<p>Much of the price is dependent on the public perception of the
currency.</p>
<p>Here are a few things that affected it.</p>
<p>Speculation about how the SEC would rule on the DAO Hack led to a
drop in prices, since more SEC regulation would mean that it would be
much harder to trade cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the advent of cryptocurrency exchange-traded-funds
like the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF meant that the average person could
invest in cryptocurrencies without having to worry about dealing with
exchanges and storing the tokens.</p>
<p>Initial coin offerings, or ICOs, have also been a huge factor in the
price of Ether.</p>
<p>We’ll talk more about them later on, but know that in the third
quarter of 2017 Q3’17, ICOs have raised $1.3B with 150 ICOs while
seed/angel investing across all tech sectors has raised $1.4B across
1602 deals.</p>
<p>Venture capital funds have also started investing into Ethereum
technology, either into the ICO like Blockchain Capital, or directly
into the token like Polychain Capital.</p>
<p>Given the exploding interest surrounding cryptocurrencies, FOMO, or
“Fear of Missing Out” plays a role in many people’s investing
decisions.</p>
<p>For better or for worse, people don’t want to miss out on the “next
bitcoin”, and end up investing in cryptocurrencies like Ether, driving
the price in upin a positive feedback loop.</p>
<p>The fact that Bitcoin’s and other cryptocurrencies’ prices are
starting to be broadcasted on public radio further contributes to this
“FOMO.”</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And economic and political circumstances like Brexit, Trump’s
election, or India’s war on cash can also contribute to driving up the
price of cryptocurrencies, since they tend to undermine people’s trust
in centralized systems and cause them to shift towards more
decentralized systems like cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Due to some economic and political situations, and of course the
aforementioned Fear of Missing Out, cryptocurrencies became extremely
popular, resulting in a massive hype train.</p>

<p>In December 2017, cryptocurrencies started attracting much more
“mainstream” attention, and let to a change in the demographic of the
people who were invest, in particular, an increase in the number of
millennials getting involved.</p>
<p>A decentralized application built on top of Ethereum called
CryptoKitties, an online marketplace for virtual cats, became so popular
that at one point, it contributed to 10% of Ethereum’s total network
transaction volume.</p>
<p>It’s important to have an educated understanding of the space……rather
than make decisions based on volatility and prices.</p>

<p>Although the price of Bitcoin is many, many times higher than what it
was a year ago, it’s started to take a downward turn in the beginning of
2018 after peaking in December 2017.</p>
<p>An increase in the amount of international regulation especially in
India…South Korea…US and the UK, combined with a “mob mentality” of
people investing without truly believing in the technology led to
quickly changing market caps, and eventually the hype train crashed.</p>
<h3 id="intro-enterprise-blockchain">Intro: Enterprise Blockchain</h3>
<p>While blockchain technology was initially developed to underlie
cryptocurrencies, it quickly drew the attention of enterprises, which
wanted to harness the same technology to create private or permissioned
blockchains.</p>
<p>Thus, gave rise to enterprise blockchains.</p>
<p>We’ve been talking a lot about public blockchains like Bitcoin and
Ethereum.</p>
<p>Now we’ll be switching gears to see how blockchain fits in with
enterprises, particularly with banks – ironically enough.</p>
<p>As a technology that was initially created to avoid large banks and
powerful centralized institutions, blockchain seems to have come full
circle…</p>
<h3 id="banks-and-blockchain">Banks and Blockchain</h3>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As blockchain became more mainstream, banks started to pick up on the
technology as well.</p>
<p>They took note of Bitcoin and what it offered as a digital currency,
but did not agree with Bitcoin’s design goals of being open,
decentralized, and trustless.</p>
<p>After all, banks want their users to trust them, and keep operations
private and controllable.</p>
<p>Banks looked for a way to apply blockchain technology WITHOUT having
to replace the US dollar or any other national currency with
cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>They wanted to find ways to leverage this new distributed ledger
technology without inheriting the trustless, distributed, and
decentralized overhead from Bitcoin.</p>
<p>This led to a rise of interest in “private blockchains” or
“permissioned ledgers,” where the network is not open, not trustless,
and does not have a mining scheme with underlying economic incentives
(mining rewards).</p>
<p>In a sense, they wanted to separate “blockchain” from “Bitcoin”.</p>
<p>These blockchains take the fundamental cryptographic technology from
bitcoin (public key cryptography) and modify it to be more compliant to
enterprise use.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>There are many different enterprise technologies in the space today,
including R3’s Corda, Chain, JP Morgan’s Quorum and Juno, and Digital
Asset Holdings.</p>
<p>The Hyperledger project is an open source blockchain run by Digital
Asset Holdings and the Linux Foundation.</p>
<p>IBM’s Open Blockchain is a platform that is now part of the
Hyperledger project as “Fabric”.</p>
<p>The way that companies, especially financial institutions, have
looked at blockchain technology has changed drastically over the past
few years.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look specifically at Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan
Chase…</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-----------------------------------  -------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image059-dimon-quotes.png” alt=”

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>…As one of the most influential figures in the financial sector, his
words can play a huge part in shaping the public opinion on
blockchain.</p>
<p>In January 2014, he said about Bitcoin “It’s a terrible store of
value. It could be replicated over and over.”, which doesn’t really mean
anything, indicating that people really didn’t, and still don’t
understand what Bitcoin is.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-----------------------------------  -------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image060-dimon-quotes-2.png” alt=”
“&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In October 2014, he said “[Bitcoin developers] are going to try and
eat our lunch. And that’s fine. That’s called competition, and we’ll be
competing.”</p>
<p>The statement seems aggressive, but he actually gives legitimacy to
Bitcoin by suggesting that it’s a competitor to traditional banks and
finance.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-----------------------------------  -------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image061-dimon-quotes-3.png” alt=”
“&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In November 2015, “Virtual currency, where it’s called a bitcoin
vs. a US Dollar, that’s going to be stopped…No government will ever
support a virtual currency that goes around borders and doesn’t have the
same control. It’s not going to happen.”</p>
<p>Now, Bitcoin isn’t just competition, it’s a bona fide threat.</p>
<p>It’s something that bankers can’t control, and they hate it.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-----------------------------------  -------------------------------------->

“&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In October 2017, he said “Bitcoin is a fraud that won’t end well. If
you’re stupid enough to buy Bitcoin, you’ll pay for the price of it one
day. The blockchain is a technology which is a good technology. We
actually use it…God bless the blockchain.”</p>
<p>Note that it looks like Dimon has started to understand the merits of
blockchain technology as opposed to just Bitcoin itself.</p>
<p>His stance towards Bitcoin doesn’t seem to have changed.</p>
<p>These comments were actually made at an event hosted by the Institute
of International Finance, which was hugely publicized.</p>
<p>Just to drive his point home, here are some more comments he made in
September 2017.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>“I’d fire a JP Morgan trader in a second who traded [Bitcoin]. It’s
against the rules, it’s stupid, it’s dangerous.”</p>
<p>And in another quote he said “One of my daughters bought bitcoin and
it went up, she thinks she is a genius.”</p>

<p>In January 2018, he said “The blockchain is real. You can have crypto
yen and dollars and stuff like that … the bitcoin to me was always what
the governments are gonna feel about bitcoin as it gets really big, and
I just have a different opinion than other people.”</p>

Chase, one of the largest American multinational financial services

<p>The history of Bitcoin and Blockchain is a story of rapid
transformation.</p>
<p>Originating as a fledgling technology founded on libertarian ideals,
Bitcoin had its beginnings in an industry full of scandals and
activity.</p>
<p>As bitcoin began to rise in value and attract attention from a wider
and wider audience, there was a shift in focus away from Bitcoin itself
and more into the other innovations made possible by the underlying
technology, the blockchain.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Where exactly do people discuss bitcoin and blockchain
technology?</p>
<p>There are a few different forums that people use.</p>
<p>There’s Reddit’s r/bitcoin, online discussion boards like
Bitcointalk.org, Bitcoin meetups and conferences, and Bitcoin specific
IRC Channels.</p>
<p>There are also organizations like us (Blockchain at Berkeley), that
are dedicated to discussing and pushing forward blockchain
technology.</p>
<p>We have a Slack channel with over 2000 members that people use to
discuss news and developments in the blockchain space.</p>
<p>We also host many public events, workshops, and meetups, teach
multiple classes on the UC Berkeley campus, and also this one
online.</p>

debate going on.</p>
<p>For example, there’s a lot of the internal politics that occurs
between miners, who want higher transaction fees, and merchants, who
want lower transaction fees.</p>
<p>There’s also politics regarding the scalability debate in Bitcoin,
the Ethereum split, and many other issues in the space.</p>
<p>Most of the core Bitcoin community can be very libertarian, as we’ve
seen with the roots of Bitcoin and the cypherpunks.</p>
<p>And oftentimes, people’s political views influence how they feel
towards technological debates as well.</p>
<p>It’s a common sentiment that getting die hard libertarians to agree
is a very hard problem.</p>
<p>Many libertarians think that implementing blockchain into the
government is a good way to hold governments accountable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, libertarians also think that people should be able
to do what they want.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Nowadays, you can’t speak about the state of the blockchain industry
without at least mentioning ICOs, or initial coin offerings.</p>
<p>They’re a way for new projects, startups, and companies to sell their
underlying crypto tokens in exchange for investors’ money.</p>
<p>Think of ICOs as Initial Public Offerings, but instead of investors
purchasing shares of a company, they purchase the coin underlying a new
project.</p>
<p>ICOs are very different from equity.</p>
<p>Having a new project’s coin doesn’t give you ownership of the
project, but instead enable you to use the project when it becomes
available.</p>
<p>Thereby, by buying into an ICO, it shows that you are interested in
this new project.</p>
<p>This incentivizes others to do the same, showing that the project
will probably be widely used, since without the associated token, you
can’t use the project.</p>
<p>For example, here are a couple famous ICOs: Bancor ICO raised $150
million</p>
<p>Tezos (XTZ) ICO raised $200 million Filecoin ICO raised $253
million</p>
<p>ICOs are permissionless and enable ANYONE to invest in a project that
they feel will be successful.</p>
<p>We put emphasis on the word ANYONE because of the open and public
nature of these cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>“95% of Americans are not allowed by law to invest in start-ups.</p>
<p>Only ‘accredited investors’ are entitled to do so, but you can buy
lottery tickets all you want or go to Las Vegas to gamble”</p>
<p>This shows that ICOs are leveling the playing field for
investments.</p>
<p>Normal people now can invest in any blockchain project they want
to.</p>

than others, the community needs some way to support them.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most popular projects of 2017 was
Cryptokitties.</p>
<p>The idea behind Cryptokitties was to allow users to purchase,
collect, breed, and sell various types of virtual cats in a virtual game
run on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Each Cryptokitty is unique and ownership is validated through the
blockchain.</p>
<p>Initially presented as a hackathon project at EthWaterloo in October
2017, Cryptokitties launched at the end of November 2017 and its
popularity quickly skyrocketed – so much so that in December,
Cryptokitties was responsible for an all-time high transaction volume,
congesting and significantly slowing down the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>Some have blamed Cryptokitties for blocking out “more serious”
transactions on the Ethereum network, and some have compared
Cryptokitties to the Beanie Baby craze, saying that both are naturally
devoid of value.</p>
<p>On the bright side, however, some people think that cryptokitties
contributed to the popularity of ethereum and brought public awareness
to the cryptocurrency space, which is helpful for the public adoption of
cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>It’s clear that cryptocurrencies and blockchain are hugely popular
now.</p>
<p>Whether or not its mainstream spotlight and growing popularity is a
good thing is another question.</p>

<p>With the growing popularity of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, it’s
important to have good wallet software.</p>
<p>Parity wallet is a popular multisignature wallet, which requires
multiple people to sign off on transactions, and was created by Ethereum
co-founder Gavin Wood and his team at Parity Technologies.</p>

<p>A user by the name of devops199 accidentally locked up 300 million US
dollars worth of ether that had been owned by users of Parity multisig
wallet.</p>
<p>One note: by the time I went to GitHub to take a screenshot of the
issue devops199 opened up, they had already deleted their account –
which is why it says “Ghost,” which is what it says for deleted
users.</p>
<p>Parity had relied on an external smart contract to use as a software
library for more heavy computation, and this smart contract had not had
an extensive security audit before launch on the public Ethereum
network.</p>
<p>All it took was for one curious learner to call the “kill” function –
and then 300 million was lost.</p>
<p>Due to Ethereum architecture, and the immutability of public
blockchains, code that is published is hard to take down, so it’s
important that smart contracts do not have bugs.</p>

whole, and taught developers – especially open source developers – to

<p>Coincheck was marketed as one of the largest and most popular
cryptocurrency exchanges in Asia – at least up until a hack in January
2018 that after the dust had settled turned out to be the largest
cryptocurrency hack in history.</p>
<p>More than half a billion US dollars were stolen in the Coincheck hack
of January 2018.</p>
<p>Compare this to the already immense Mt. Gox hack in 2014 that
resulted in 400 million US dollars stolen or lost.</p>
<p>Coincheck estimated that upwards of 250,000 (two hundred fifty
thousand) users were affected by the hack, and reassured users that it
was not an inside job, but a legitimate breach and hack.</p>
<p>Most of the cryptocurrency stolen in the Coincheck hack was lost in a
single event.</p>
<p>And compare this with Mt. Gox, which we had mentioned lost a majority
of its cryptocurrency through multiple thefts across a span of multiple
years.</p>
<p>The landscape for crypto and blockchain is pretty wild in the current
day.</p>
<p>There are a lot of exchanges, wallet software, and other blockchain
utility applications, and an even greater number of ICOs out there.</p>
<p>Since blockchain is still young, it’s important to do your own due
diligence when using blockchain software.</p>
<p>Looking at the broader picture, that’s one of the goals of this
course – to get you to start thinking critically about blockchain
fundamentals and the more technical aspects about the technology that
can then help inform your own personal decisions.</p>
<h3 id="modulelecture-2-summary">Module/Lecture 2 Summary</h3>
<h3 id="pre-bitcoin-libertarian-dreams">Pre-Bitcoin: Libertarian
Dreams</h3>
<p>In the face of increasingly powerful banks and national agencies, the
Cypherpunks and Crypto-anarchists of the late 1980s advocated the use of
cryptography to preserve privacy, which they defined as the power to
selectively reveal oneself. They sought to develop an anonymous digital
transaction system. </p>
<p>In October 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper,
which outlined, for the first time, an anonymous, trustless,
decentralized cryptocurrency.Bitcoin was built upon a history of failed
cryptocurrencies, including Digicash, Hashcash, and B-money. Bitcoin
relies on Proof-of-Work, a peer validation protocol introduced by
Hashcash, that expends computational power to solve cryptographic
puzzles and to cast votes. As in Digicash, each node in Bitcoin
maintains their own identity through public and private keys,
authenticating transactions using blind signatures. As in B-money, every
Bitcoin full node maintains a copy of the blockchain. Bitcoin is a
deflationary currency, with 21 million total bitcoins that will be
slowly introduced to the bitcoin supply via block rewards.</p>
<p>The first transaction using Bitcoin to purchase a tangible asset
occurred in 2010, when Laszlo Hanyecz exchanged 10,000 bitcoin for $25
worth of pizza. This exchange gave bitcoins real value, a first step
towards legitimacy. </p>

<h3 id="early-bitcoin-scandals-hacks-and-illegal-activity">Early
Bitcoin: Scandals, Hacks, and Illegal Activity</h3>
<p>As Bitcoin began increasing in popularity, it also began facing
increasing cases of thefts, hacks, and illegal activity. The first was a
large hack on Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange (Mt. Gox), one of the
first Bitcoin exchange website created in 2010. </p>
<p>Bitcoin was also used for the purchase of illegal substances on the
dark web, especially through the website “Silk Road,” nicknamed the
“eBay for Drugs.” As Bitcoin became more accessible and useful to the
public, it steadily grew in value, reaching a bubble in 2013.</p>
<p>Altcoins, such as Litecoin, ZCash, Stellar, Ripple, Ethereum,
Dogecoin, DASH, and Monero, began popping up soon after Bitcoin’s
success, each serving a different functionality.</p>
<p>In 2014, merchants, such as Overstock.com and PayPal (with Coinbase),
started accepting Bitcoin. Bitcoin startups and wallet companies,
including Coinbase, Bitpay, and Blockchain.info, started appearing
around this time as well. Around this time, people started to
differentiate between the term blockchain from Bitcoin. </p>
<h3 id="scalability-debates-and-ethereum">Scalability Debates and
Ethereum</h3>
<p>Bitcoin is far from perfect. One of the biggest technological
challenges Bitcoin faces is that of scalability. Such issues raise
concern of decentralized governance. Currently, Bitcoin users may
propose Bitcoin Improvement Protocols on online forums and gather ad hoc
community votes on proposed matters.</p>
<p>Another influential blockchain platform is Ethereum. While Bitcoin is
a storage of value, Ethereum is a platform designed to execute arbitrary
code called “smart contracts”. Users pay for code execution using
Ethereum’s internal token, called ether. With Ethereum’s introduction,
Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), programs on the Ethereum
blockchain that create a distributed government, gained popularity. “The
DAO” was a decentralized Venture Capital DAO that suffered a $120 M hack
in 2016. Disagreement about whether to roll back the history of
transactions to before the hack led to two versions of Ethereum.
Ethereum(the main chain) rewound the transaction history to before the
hack, whereas Ethereum Classic continued the original chain despite the
hack. </p>
<p>While concerns of the SEC’s reaction to The DAO hack initially
lowered Ethereum’s price, the growing popularity of Initial Coin
Offerings and cryptocurrency exchange-traded-funds increased Ethereum’s
price overall. Economic and political changes in early 2017 along with
an expansion of the crypto user base to include millennials further
contributed to growth in Ethereum value and transaction volume.</p>
<h3 id="enterprise-blockchain">Enterprise Blockchain</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, banks started seeking ways to apply blockchain technology
leading to an increased interest in “private blockchains.” Enterprise
blockchain technologies today include R3’s Corda, Chain, JP Morgan’s
Quorum and Juno, Digital Asset Holdings, and IBM’s hyperledger.
Blockchain has come a long way – from online ideation amongst
Cypherpunks to adoption by JP Morgan Chase.</p>
<p>The blockchain space has expanded to include not only major financial
institutions, but also the general public. Initial Coin Offerings,
equity-less fundraising schemes for new crypto startups that allow
anyone to participate, and the advent of Cryptokitties, an online
marketplace for virtual cats, indicate the spread of blockchain across
communities and also to popular culture.</p>

<p>We’ve seen how Bitcoin works at a high level.</p>

of Bitcoin that make it work.</p>

<p>First, let’s discuss cryptographic hash functions: what they are and
how they are used in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Then, we’ll see how we can use cryptographic hash functions to create
a tamper-evident database – the blockchain that we all know and
love.</p>
<p>We’ll then discuss digital signatures, the elliptic curve digital
signature algorithm, and how we actually generate and use our private
key, public key, and address.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ll introduce Bitcoin script and its functionality as well
as its role in making Bitcoin more flexible.</p>
<h3 id="intro-motivations-and-definitions">Intro: Motivations and
Definitions</h3>
<p>Recall our earlier assumptions about Bitcoin: we can’t trust
anyone.</p>
<p>Before, we considered trust in the context of consensus, but what
about information that moves through the network?</p>
<p>For example, if someone sees a block with my transaction in it,
what’s to stop them from modifying or even replacing it?</p>
<p>We previously demonstrated how to have consensus on updates to the
blockchain through Proof-of-Work.</p>
<p>Now, we will demonstrate how we can be certain that the update is the
same for everyone by designing a tamper evident system.</p>
<p>Tamper evident means that although information can be tampered, it is
obvious that there has been some manipulation of the information.</p>
<p>We’ll see that in order to design our tamper evident database, we
first need a source of standardized randomness.</p>
<p>For this, we’ll utilize cryptographic hash functions.</p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A simple way to do this is with some fingerprinting system.</p>
<p>How do fingerprints apply?</p>
<p>Well, think of human fingerprints.</p>
<p>Each one is unique, difficult to forge, and close to impossible to
predict.</p>
<p>When entering another country, they often ask for your fingerprint as
that is a unique identifier of you.</p>
<p>If you are someone else, then your fingerprint changes.</p>
<p>The same applies in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Except instead of humans and thumbs, we have meaningful information
and random data.</p>
<p>If we can design a way to generate fingerprints of our meaningful
data, then we can ensure the integrity of our information.</p>
<p>With this fingerprint system, if the information is changed, then so
is the fingerprint.</p>
<p>Here’s the fascinating thing about fingerprints: when you really
think about it, fingerprints are just standardized randomness.</p>
<p>You can’t guess what someone’s fingerprint will look like, just by
looking at them.</p>
<p>In the same way, you shouldn’t be able to guess the data that
produced a digital fingerprint.</p>
<p>But how do we all agree on a way to generate fingerprints?</p>
<p>We need standardized randomness.</p>

<p>Cryptographic hash functions are one way functions that take some
input and produce a pseudorandom output.</p>
<p>We say pseudorandom because, while it appears random to us, it is
actually always going to be the same output for some given input.</p>
<p>In other words, if I take the hash of “hello, world!” once, it will
be the same if I do it a second time.</p>
<p>This is necessary for standardization between all parties.</p>
<p>A cryptographic hash function always outputs a message of some given
size.</p>
<p>One note is that we call the output the image, and the input the pre
image.</p>

<p>Cryptographic hash functions differ from regular hash functions in
that they are built for security, but for convenience, we will now refer
to cryptographic hash functions as hash functions.</p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What are the properties of hash functions then?</p>
<p>Well, we have <em>three</em> important properties to discuss:
<em>pre-image</em> and <em>second-preimage</em> resistance, along with
<em>collision</em> resistance.</p>
<p>To clarify what these terms mean, let’s go over a couple
definitions.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------------- image084-cryptographic-hash-functions-preimage-resistance.png -------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%”
src=“/images/image084-cryptographic-hash-functions-preimage-resistance.png”
alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Pre-image” resistance is synonymous with “input.”</p>
<p>“Resistance” is synonymous with difficulty.</p>
<p>For example, “pre-image resistance” refers to the difficulty of
finding an input given some output.</p>
<p>We’ll dive more into each shortly.</p>
<p>Key Properties of Cryptographic Hash Functions: Pre-Image
Resistance</p>
<p>First off, we want to make sure that no one can reverse engineer our
fingerprint.</p>
<p>Otherwise, certain issues come up, such as exposing information that
we didn’t want to reveal.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------------- image085-cryptographic-hash-functions-preimage-resistance.png -------------------------------------->

alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To make sure this doesn’t happen, we need what’s known as preimage
resistance.</p>
<p>The technical definition is as follows: given some hash function H
and some output of the function H of x, it is computationally difficult
to find x.</p>
<p>In other words, we cannot easily discover the input which created
some output.</p>

<p>Key Properties of Cryptographic Hash Functions: Second Preimage
Resistance</p>
<p>Next, we want to make sure that no one can steal fingerprints.</p>
<p>If someone else can generate my fingerprint with a different input,
then no one can tell who originally made the fingerprint.</p>
<p>To make sure this doesn’t happen, we need what’s known as second
preimage resistance.</p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The technical definition is as follows: given some hash function H
and some output H of x, it is computationally difficult to find a
different input x’ such that H of x equals H of x’.</p>
<h3
id="key-properties-of-cryptographic-hash-functions-collision-resistance">Key
Properties of Cryptographic Hash Functions: Collision Resistance</h3>
<p>Expanding the concept of second preimage resistance, we generally
recognize that any two arbitrary inputs mapping to the same output is a
bad thing.</p>
<p>To prevent this, we need collision resistance.</p>
<p>The technical definition is as follows: given some hash function H,
it is computationally difficult to find two different inputs x and y
such that H of x equals H of y.</p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Consequences of these properties is what’s known as the Avalanche
Effect.</p>
<p>This means that any change in the input leads to a pseudorandom
change in the output.</p>
<p>This prevents a hot or cold game with inputs, where you attempt to
guess the output based on inputs.</p>
<p>On the right side, we’ve hashed the string “I am Satoshi Nakamoto0”,
“I am Satoshi Nakamoto1”, all the way to 19…</p>
<p>And each result is pseudo random.</p>

<h3 id="sha2562-secure-hash-algorithm">SHA256^2 – (Secure Hash
Algorithm)</h3>
<p>The particular hash function that Bitcoin chooses to use in many
scenarios is called SHA-256.</p>
<p>SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function that was designed by the
NSA.</p>
<p>SHA-256 is a member of the SHA-2 family of cryptographic hash
functions, SHA standing for Secure Hash Algorithm.</p>
<p>SHA-256 takes in an input of size less than 2^64 bits and produces a
256 bit fixed size output.</p>
<p>In practice, the 2^64 bit upper bound on the input size is so massive
that we usually just say that it takes in an arbitrary amount of
information.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, in many cases, uses SHA-256 squared, or SHA256d, which
simply means that SHA-256 is used twice in a row.</p>
<p>Once on the original message you want to hash, and another time on
the output of this first hash.</p>

<p>The <em>Previous Block Hash</em> represents the chaining.</p>

<p>Let’s first take a look at the Merkle Root.</p>
<h3 id="merkle-trees">Merkle Trees:</h3>

<p> </p>
<p>What is a Merkle Root, and what do we mean by a summary of
transactions?</p>
<p>Does this mean that we have contained all information about our
transactions in one piece of information?</p>
<p>Well, it actually means that we have contained all fingerprints of
information in one piece of data.</p>
<p>The Merkle Root is the top of a Merkle Tree, which is a cryptographic
data structure.</p>
<p>This is definitely complicated, so let’s take it slow and start from
the very beginning.</p>
<p>First and foremost, a tree in Computer science is a data structure
that has some root node and some children, which may also be the roots
of other trees.</p>
<p>A binary tree is a tree in which every node has at most two
children.</p>
<p>A <em>Merkle Tree</em> is just a very specific version of a binary
tree, where two things are true:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>there are a power of two children on the bottommost level,
and</p></li>
<li><p>the lowest level is made of the hashes of the information that
you would like to summarize.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps a better way to explain the Merkle Tree is to describe its
construction.</p>
<p>We start off with a set of transactions that we have verified.</p>
<p>We lay them out one by one.</p>
<p>We hash each one to get a level of hashes.</p>
<p>We then hash each pair together, making a new level with half as many
hashes.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-----------------------------------  -------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image099-tamper-protect.png” alt=”
“&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We continue this process until we finally have only one hash at the
top.</p>
<p>This hash at the very top is the Merkle Root.</p>
<p>This way, we can detect any transaction changes after the commitment
with the Merkle Root.</p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We see here that if any transaction is changed, then the Merkle Root
is affected.</p>
<p>This is demonstrated in the following diagram: when Transaction 3 is
changed, then so is its hash.</p>
<p>Because of that, the hash above it is also effective, propagating all
the way up to the topmost level.</p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You may ask, “Isn’t it expensive to verify that a transaction was
included within a Merkle Tree?”</p>
<p>Don’t worry, we don’t need to recollect every transaction to do
that.</p>
<p>We can actually prove it with just one piece of information at each
depth.</p>
<p>You’ll notice that we only need to hash Transaction 1 with these two
pieces of information:</p>
<p>Hash B, and Hash F.</p>
<p>This is actually a great efficiency gain as our tree grows
larger.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>It’s pretty obvious what the Previous Block Hash does: It merely
contains the hash of the previous block.</p>

<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image104.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But notice this: every block does that.</p>
<p>This means that if any block is altered, then the block after will
also be altered, and so will the block after that.</p>
<p>Changing any part of this history also changes the entire future
after that point.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of what happens when that tampered Merkle Root from
before manifests within the blockchain.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image105-tamper.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It changes the block header, which changes the next block’s Prev
Block Hash, which affects the rest of the future block hashes as
well.</p>
<p>The rest of the network will reject the history proposed by this
blockchain because they will not agree.</p>
<p>This is why the blockchain is considered immutable, because all
tampering is easy to see.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Work: Partial Preimage Hash Puzzle</p>
<p>Now that we’ve finished talking about how Prev Block Hashes, let’s
talk about the <strong>nonce</strong>, the physical manifestation of
Proof-of-Work.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-----------------------------------  -------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image105-tamper-nonce.png” alt=”
“&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Keep in mind that we need entities to prove that they’ve done some
work before they’re allowed to submit a vote to the network, meaning
that we have to design a problem or puzzle for their computers to solve
to prove that they’ve done work.</p>
<p>The way we do this in Bitcoin is with a partial preimage hash
puzzle.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-----------------------------------  -------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">

&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image104-partial-preimage-2.png” alt=”
“&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Keep in mind the definition of preimage from before, which was the
input.</p>
<p>Partial preimage then means a partial input.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, we are given part of an input, and we have to find the
other part which produces some particular output.</p>
<p>The condition that needs to be met is that the hash of the block
header is less than some target value.</p>
<p>This condition is how <em>Proof-of-Work</em> is implemented in
Bitcoin and almost every other popular <em>Proof-of-Work</em>
cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>To satisfy our needs for a puzzle, these hash puzzles need to have
<strong>three</strong> characteristics:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Computationally difficult,</p></li>
<li><p>Parameterizable, and</p></li>
<li><p>Easily verifiable.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Computational difficulty means ensuring that the solution to the
puzzle cannot be easily found.</p>

<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image104-partial-preimage-3.png” alt=”

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There’s no point if <em>Proof-of-Work</em> takes little work.</p>
<p>Parameterizable means adjustable.</p>
<p>The difficulty of the puzzle should be adjustable to ensure that it
never gets too easy or too hard.</p>
<p>And finally, an easily verifiable puzzle ensures that computers don’t
have to do too much work to see that an answer is correct.</p>
<p>It should just take one hash for example to prove that some nonce is
correct, even if finding the nonce takes millions of tries.</p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a better idea of how mining works, let’s bring up an analogy.</p>
<p>Mining is like throwing darts at a target while blindfolded.</p>
<p>This implies <strong><em>two</em></strong> things.</p>
<p><strong><em>First</em></strong>, we have an equal likelihood of
hitting any part of the target.</p>
<p>We have no way of knowing what’s closer to or farther from the
center.</p>
<p><strong><em>Two</em></strong>, the only way we can be more likely to
ever hit the center is by throwing more darts.</p>
<p>Again, since we have no way of trying to make any individual dart
more likely to hit the center, the best we can do is throw more.</p>
<p>This compares to mining because miners are looking for some hash
output that is below some algorithmically decided target.</p>
<p>It’s as if that target is the green line dividing the valid and
invalid blocks in the diagram.</p>
<h3 id="proof-of-work-block-difficulty">Proof-of-Work: Block
Difficulty</h3>

&lt;
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image108.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How do we adjust the size of this circle?</p>
<p>How do we set and change the target?</p>
<p>This all happens through the difficulty, which is a representation of
the number of expected computations required to find a block.</p>
<p>Again, we can’t predict how many computations anyone produces to
solve the puzzle, but we can approximate based on how quickly the puzzle
is solved on average.</p>
<p>The difficulty is implemented as a requirement of a leading number of
zeros on the block header hash.</p>
<p>This is why the example block at the start of this section had many
zeros at the start of its block hash.</p>
<p>As the number of zeros increases, so will the difficulty, and vice
versa.</p>
<p>This difficulty adjusts with the global hashrate.</p>
<p>We know that the amount of computing power in the network will always
be changing, as miners join and leave the network, but we want to
maintain a block time of ten minutes.</p>
<p>For this reason, we have to raise and lower the difficulty alongside
the hashpower growth and decay of the network.</p>
<p>The way we recalculate this difficulty is with the equation on the
slide: difficulty is equal to itself times the ratio of two weeks to the
time taken to mine the previous 2016 blocks.</p>
<p>Every two weeks, we check to see how long it took to calculate those
2016 blocks.</p>
<p>If every block took exactly 10 minutes, then it should have taken
precisely two weeks to produce those 2016 blocks.</p>
<p>If we took too long, it’s because the puzzle was too hard to solve,
and if we didn’t take long enough, then the puzzle was too easy.</p>
<p>We make adjustments on the puzzle difficulty accordingly going
forward.</p>
<p>A quick sanity check to see if your understanding is correct.</p>

exactly two weeks?</p>

<p>The puzzle was precisely as hard as we wanted, so the difficulty
stays exactly the same.</p>

<p>What about when the time to mine those 2016 blocks is just one
week?</p>
<p>Or a staggering 4 weeks?</p>
<p>If time to mine is one week, then the difficulty is 20!</p>
<p>We mined those blocks in half the expected time, meaning that the
puzzle was half as hard as necessary, so we make it twice as
difficult.</p>
<p>If the time to mine is 4 weeks now, the difficulty is now 5!</p>
<p>We mined those blocks in twice the expected time, meaning that the
puzzle was twice as hard as necessary, so we make it half as
difficult.</p>

<p>You might be asking, where does the block reward to miners even
go?</p>
<p>Well, it goes in the coinbase transaction!</p>
<p>Whenever a miner produces a block, they first make a coinbase
transaction which is always the first transaction of the Merkle
Tree.</p>
<p>This coinbase transaction grants miners a reward of some bitcoins
which can be spent at some later date.</p>
<p>This is how new bitcoins are minted, or introduced, into the
network.</p>
Also, the Coinbase transaction has a separate nonce field that is used
in our hash puzzle as well.

<p>Here’s some mining pseudo code.</p>
<p>We loop infinitely until we find a valid block.</p>
<p>In each loop, we try a Coinbase nonce first, and then in an inner
loop, exhaust all possible values for header nonces.</p>
<p>Then we increment the Coinbase nonce, and repeat this cycle.</p>
<p>The reason why we want to do this in this order: to exhaust all
header nonces for each coinbase nonce, is that changing the Coinbase
nonce changes the merkle root.</p>
<p>It would be more expensive to recalculate the merkle root each time
on each iteration of the inner loop.</p>
<p>We optimize by trying nonces in such a way as to only have to
calculate the merkle root in each iteration of the outermost loop.</p>
<h3 id="intro-signatures-and-authentication">Intro: Signatures and
Authentication</h3>
<p>Now we’ll go into how to use digital signatures to send messages and
transactions both pseudonymously and trustlessly.</p>
<p>In the previous section, we showed how transactions contained in
previous blocks in the blockchain are tamper evident.</p>
<p>Using digital signatures, we can also ensure that the current
transactions we send to the rest of the network are tamper evident as
well.</p>
<p>Recall from early in the course that our motivation for having
signatures is to authenticate identity, so that you know a message you
receive could only have come from one other user, because it was signed
with that user’s specific private key, proving ownership of a public
key.</p>
<p>In this next section, we’ll go over what we want from a digital
signature scheme at a high level.</p>
<h3 id="digital-signature-schemes-dss">Digital Signature Schemes

<p> </p>
<p>Consider two users on the network: call them Alice and Bob.</p>
<p>Recall that they both have private and public keys.</p>
<p>Private and public keys in Bitcoin are generated through an algorithm
called ECDSA, or Elliptic</p>
<h3 id="curve-digital-signature-algorithm.">Curve Digital Signature
Algorithm.</h3>
<p>We’ll go over that in the next section.</p>
<p>Alice wants to send over a message to Bob.</p>
How can she do this and make sure no one tampers with her message?
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-----------------------------------  -------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image117-dss-2.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>First we point out that Bob has access to Alice’s public key, since
that’s public information that’s used to identify Alice.</p>
<p>We’ll see later on that this is important to help Bob verify that a
message coming from Alice was actually sent by Alice.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-----------------------------------  -------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image117-dss-3.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before sending out her message, Alice signs her message with her
private key.</p>
<p>This generates a unique signature that proves that she created the
message as it is.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-----------------------------------  -------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image117-dss-4.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She then sends her signature along with her original message to
Bob.</p>
<p>The idea is that the message is the main payload, and the signature
can be used to prove that Alice was the one who created that exact
message.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-----------------------------------  -------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image117-dss-5” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bob is then able to easily verify that the signature is valid, given
Alice’s public key and the original message.</p>
<p>And if the signature is valid, then that means the message wasn’t
tampered with.</p>
<p>In order for Alice to have created that signature, she must have had
the associated private key.</p>
<p>Also, at any point in time if her message was tampered with, the
signature could not be valid anymore.</p>
<p>This is how digital signature schemes make messages tamper
evident.</p>

<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image117-dss-6.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A key point is that Bob or anyone else should not be able to guess
Alice’s private key, given just her public key.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Bob or anyone else would be able to recreate Alice’s
signatures and thus fake her identity.</p>
<p>We’ll see how this is prevented in the next section, where we explain
the way we generate public and private key pairs.</p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In summary, here are some key properties that we should keep in
mind.</p>
<p>These are essential properties of digital signature schemes that are
enabled by the functionality that we went over just now with Alice
sending a message to Bob.</p>
<p>First, given a message and a signature, as well as a copy of the
sender’s public key, the recipient should be able to identify the
message origin.</p>
<p>Since the message has been signed by the sender’s private key, this
shows that the original sender has authorized this message.</p>
<p>There’s also non-repudiation, meaning that the original sender should
not be able to backtrack.</p>
<p>Since they have already signed the message with their private key,
there should not be away to undo that signature, or to nullify it.</p>
<p>And changing the message would make it such that signature wouldn’t
match up with it anymore.</p>
<p>Finally, message recipients should also be able to verify message
integrity.</p>
<p>And this is what we saw earlier: that signatures can be used so that
messages can’t be modified by anyone after signing.</p>

a public key.</p>

our Bitcoin address.</p>
<p>One important note is that the processes mentioned – the elliptic
curve point scalar multiplication and the hashing – are all one-way
processes.</p>
<p>We can go forward, but not backwards.</p>

key from the corresponding public key or address.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>To illustrate, here’s a demo.</p>
<p>We start off with a generator point P that is known to everyone,
since that’s built into secp256k1’s specification.</p>
<p>To add P with itself, simply take the tangent at the point P. Where
the line intersects the curve let’s call it -2P.</p>
<p>We then reflect this point across the x axis, resulting in our answer
2P.</p>
<p>To get 3P, we can add P to 2P via the same process.</p>
<p>Draw a line through P and 2P, find where they intersect, which is
-3P, and then reflect that across the x-axis again to yield our answer
3P.</p>

<p>Its equation is y^2 = x^3 + 7, and was engineered to have some unique
properties that we’ll be explaining in the coming slides.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, it’s taken over a finite field so as to limit
key size.</p>
<p>To illustrate, on the left side is the same curve, but over a small
field where we only have integer values -128 to 128.</p>
<p>When we take it over a finite field, it doesn’t look like a smooth
curve anymore.</p>
<p>However, there are unique properties of elliptic curves that will
help us in creating a one-way function to generate public keys from
private keys.</p>
<p>So as mentioned earlier, Bitcoin’s elliptic curve is secp256k1.</p>
<p>This curve is specified with a couple parameters, including the
actual curve formula itself (by its coefficients), the field, and a
generator point.</p>
<p>Note the symmetry of the curve across the x axis.</p>
<p>This symmetry is preserved even when taking it over a finite
field.</p>
<p>Also note that any non-vertical line on this curve will intersect the
curve in at most 3 points.</p>
<p>On the graph on the right hand side, the line through points P and Q
intersect at point R.</p>
<p>On this elliptic curve, we can do point addition using lines and
points.</p>
<p>To add P plus Q, we can simply draw a line through them, intersecting
at a third point R, and then reflect the point R across the x-axis ,
yielding our result P + Q.</p>
<p>And this is called the chord tangent process.</p>
<p>This is a trapdoor, or one-way, function, because given a point K
that is P + Q, it is difficult to find the individual points P and
Q.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The user generates a random number n for their private key.</p>
<p>They use elliptic curve point scalar multiplication by n to generate
their public key: they add a known generator point P for secp256k1 with
itself n times.</p>
<p>Then, to generate the address, we hash the public key nP with SHA-256
first, and then with another hash function called RIPEMD160.</p>
<p>SHA-256 makes the address quantum resistant, as quantum computers
could possibly be able to break elliptic curves and reverse the one way
point scalar multiplication we defined, but quantum computers cannot
reverse hash functions.</p>
<p>RIPEMD160 then shortens the address size from 256 bits to 160
bits.</p>
<p>Now you might be wondering: given a public key nP, is it possible to
get the private key n?</p>
<p>This problem is known as the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm
Problem, and is known to be computationally infeasible.</p>
<p>We can safely say that our procedure of generating public keys from
private keys is fairly secure.</p>
<p>Public Key to Public Key Hash</p>
<p>Now that we have our public key, how do we get to our address?</p>
<p>We’ll be going over that in this section.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<p> </p>
<p>If quantum computers exist, we could use them to solve the elliptic
curve discrete logarithm problem and find the private key given a public
key.</p>
<p>Quantum computers can’t reverse hash functions, so we choose to run
two hash functions on our public key.</p>
<p>First SHA-256, which we mentioned previously as a hash function
prevalent throughout the Bitcoin protocol, and second, RIPEMD-160, which
shortens the address size down from 256 bits to 160 bits.</p>
<p>Together, the combination of using SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 is called
“double hash” or HASH160.</p>
<p>After all this, we have our public key hash.</p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And after we have our public key hash, we’re just a little bit away
from arriving at our Bitcoin address.</p>
<p>The next step is to make our pub key hash a bit more human
friendly.</p>
<p>First, we add a version byte in front of our previous RIPEMD-160 hash
from the last section.</p>
<p>In the version byte, we specify which network we’re on: the main
Bitcoin network, or a smaller test network.</p>
<p>We’ll save this for how and call it our extended RIPEMD-160 hash.</p>
<p>We then run a Base58Check encode, which first involves converting
what we have so far into base 58.</p>
<p>Base 58 is an alphabet that’s like our usual 62 character
alphabet.</p>
<p>It has all single digits 0 to 9 and all upper and lower case letters,
except for those that are hard to distinguish from one another.</p>
<p>We take out the 0 and capital letter O, and also capital “I” and
lower case “l.”</p>
<p>This is to avoid ambiguity when copying down your address.</p>
<p>Then, we calculate a checksum.</p>
<p>We perform SHA-256d on our extended RIPEMD-160 hash, running SHA-256
on it twice.</p>
<p>We take the first 4 bytes of our SHA-256d hash as our checksum, and
append it to the end of our extended RIPEMD-160 hash.</p>
<p>After converting the result to base58, we finally have our Bitcoin
address.</p>
<p>As a recap, in our address, we have successfully encoded our public
key hash, which allows people to pay us, a version byte that says what
network we’re on, and also a checksum that accounts for human error.</p>
<p>If someone types or copies down your address wrong, then the address
would not be valid given the checksum.</p>
<p>And this is something that decoding software will do for us.</p>
<p>It can hash the beginning of our address and compare it with the
checksum to see if it is valid.</p>
<h3 id="intro-bitcoin-script">Intro: Bitcoin Script</h3>
<p>Now we’ll dive into Bitcoin script.</p>
<p>Bitcoin script, or just Script, is a language that was designed to be
used for Bitcoin to process a variety of transactions – from payments
between two people, to more complex multi-signature transactions –
greatly extending the functionality of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Before we dive into specifics about how Bitcoin scripts work, it’s
important to first review how transactions work.</p>
<h3 id="remember-the-utxo-model">Remember the UTXO Model?</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------- Bitcoin Scripts: Remember the UTXO Model? --------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">

&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image133.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remember the UTXO model?</p>
<p>Bitcoin doesn’t have “accounts” with associated bitcoin tallies.</p>
<p>Rather, you can think of each transaction as outputs from previous
transactions feeding into new inputs.</p>
<p>Transactions contain the signature of the owner of the unspent
funds.</p>
<p>These unspent transactions are UTXOs.</p>
<p>How do you spend your bitcoin, or “your UTXOs”?</p>
<p>This is important: spending bitcoin is the act of redeeming previous
outputs with a proof that you are the legitimate redeemer, and then
specifying who can redeem the output you are now creating by encoding
that person’s information in your transaction.</p>
<p>For example, if I send bitcoin (in the form of UTXOs) to Rustie, then
in that transaction it’s encoded that only Rustie can redeem those
UTXOs.</p>
<p>That proof that Rustie would use to redeem his bitcoin is constructed
with two things: a <strong>public key</strong>, and a
<strong>signature.</strong></p>
<p>We’ll go more into detail later.</p>
<p>Contents of a Transaction</p>
<p>Let’s take a deeper look into the contents of my transaction to
Rustie.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------  ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image144.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As we can see, a transaction has three main “sections.”</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------  ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image145.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The metadata section contains some housekeeping data, a unique ID of
this transaction, locktime, and size.</p>
<p>The inputs section contains a list of previously created UTXOs as
well as a proof that I am eligible of redeeming the money.</p>
<p>This proof allows me to redeem the UTXOs and use them to produce new
outputs.</p>
<p>The outputs section contains a list of new UTXOs that will be sent to
new addresses.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------  ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image146.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p>Each of these values is accompanied with a script that locks the
value away from everyone except the intended redeemer who can provide a
valid proof.</p>
<p>Taking a deeper look into the transaction, we start with the
metadata.</p>
<p>The first piece of metadata is the hash of our transaction, or the
unique “ID” of this transaction.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------  ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image147.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We also get information here in the field vin_sz, which stands for
vector input size, or the number of input UTXOs being referenced in this
transaction, as well as vout_sz, which stands for vector output size, or
the number of new UTXOs being created.</p>
<p>In this case, I created this transaction with 2 UTXOs and send them
as one new UTXO to Rustie.</p>
<p>Finally, we have the version and locktime.</p>
<p>Version is a number specifying the version of the Bitcoin software
you are using.</p>
<p>We will talk more about locktime later in this lecture.</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about inputs.</p>
<p>Remember that in the metadata section we have a unique ID for this
entire transaction object that we’re talking about.</p>
<p>Well these come in handy in the inputs, with each of the hashes you
see here being references to the unique IDs of previous transactions
containing the relevant UTXOs that are being redeemed now.</p>
<p>We also get a reference to the index of the input in the previous
transaction.</p>
<p>“0” means the first input.</p>
<p>“1” means the second, and so on.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------  ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image148.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The scriptSig is the most important part of these inputs because
they’re the required proofs that prove that you can redeem the
associated UTXO.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the end product of our transaction is the
output(s).</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------  ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image149.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can see here in this particular transaction we have only one
output with a value of about 10 bitcoin.</p>
<p>Satoshi is the smallest unit of bitcoin.</p>
<p>One bitcoin can be converted to 100 million satoshi, which means that
it can be divisible to the 8th decimal place.</p>
<p>The accompanying output address is a script that locks the
transaction and makes it redeemable only by the specific proof that I
specified in this transaction.</p>
<p>In this case, only after Rustie provides his proof can he unlock and
spend my UTXOs.</p>

&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image150.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;

<p> </p>
<p>Remember: in this transaction, the output addresses are actually
scripts.</p>
<p>For this particular output script, we can read it as “This amount can
be redeemed by the public key that hashes to address X, plus a signature
from the owner of that public key.”</p>
<p>This brings us back to Script.</p>
<p>Do you have a better idea of why Bitcoin connects inputs and outputs
through scripts?</p>
<p>Rather than just connecting public keys together, connecting inputs
and outputs through scripts allows for potentially complex transaction
types.</p>
<p>The Script language is stack-based, has a native support for
cryptocurrency, and is purposely limited in capability for security
reasons.</p>
<h3 id="intro-to-p2pkh">Intro to P2PKH</h3>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image151.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let’s walk through an example of how Script works under the hood.</p>
<p>The example we are looking at is at the top of the screen.</p>
<p>This script specifies the most common type of transaction in Bitcoin,
which is to redeem a previous transaction output.</p>
<p>To redeem this previous transaction, we need to prove our identities
with (1) a public key that, when hashed, yields the address to which the
previous transaction was sent, and (2) a signature that proves ownership
of the private key corresponding to the public key we provided.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------  ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image152.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is the most common type of script in Bitcoin Pay to Public Key
Hash (shorthanded).</p>
<p>But how do we implement this functionality?</p>
<p>With locking and unlocking scripts.</p>
<p>Unlocking scripts are scripts that you provide in your input when you
want to spend from a previous transaction, allowing you to redeem the
associated bitcoin.</p>
<p>You provide the signature and your public key, which are needed to
prove your identity, and to unlock the transaction output.</p>
<p>Your public key is then hashed and checked against the address that
owns the UTXO.</p>
<p>Because you provide a signature, this script is called scriptSig.</p>
<p>Locking scripts are the scripts that are found in previous
transaction outputs.</p>
<p>The locking script specifies the requirements for redeeming a
UTXO.</p>
<p>This essentially “locks” down the UTXO, so that it can only be spent
by whoever can unlock it.</p>
<p>In our Pay to Pub Key Hash example, the locking script requires that
the users that want to spend from a previous transaction output MUST
prove that they possess a private key that hashes to a specific
address.</p>
<p>For this reason, this script is called scriptPubKey.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------  ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image153.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To make unlocking and locking scripts work in tandem, we simply
concatenate them.</p>
<p>We put the unlocking script on top of the locking script, scriptSig
on top of scriptPubKey, and then run them together.</p>
<p>And the entire resulting script must execute successfully in order
for the transaction to be considered valid.</p>
<h3 id="demo-p2pkh-example">Demo: P2PKH Example</h3>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image154.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now let’s piece everything that we’ve learned so far about Bitcoin
script together, and walk through a sample execution of Pay to Public
Key Hash.</p>
<p>First notice how the execution order is defined.</p>
<p>On the left hand side, we have the scriptSig on top, and the
scriptPubKey on the bottom.</p>
<p>The scriptSig on top is the input script to a new transaction we are
creating, and the scriptPubKey on the bottom is the output script of an
old transaction we are trying to spend from.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Script is stack-based, which is first in last out, so
execution will proceed as follows:</p>
<p>We first put our signature on the stack.</p>
<p>Then we put our public key on the stack.</p>
<p>OP_DUP will duplicate the top item on the stack OP_HASH160 hashes the
previous item on the stack, first with SHA-256, and then with
RIPEMD-160</p>
<p>Next, &lt;pubKeyHash?&gt; – with the question mark in the angle
brackets – is the actual public key hash specified by the previous
transaction output.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------  ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image155.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We put this on the stack as well OP_EQUALVERIFY then checks to see if
the top two items in the stack are equal.</p>
<p>If they are equal, we continue with execution.</p>
<p>If not, then the transaction is invalid and we stop execution.</p>
<p>In this case, let’s say the transaction is valid, so we keep going
with execution.</p>
<p>Lastly, OP_CHECKSIG checks the validity of the signature with the
given public key.</p>
<p>If it’s valid, then it returns true.</p>
<p>And then finally, since the final return value is true, we know that
the transaction was valid, and so the transaction will go through.</p>

<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image156.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Something cool you can do with Bitcoin Script is write arbitrary data
into the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p>This is the idea behind proof of burn.</p>
<p>There’s an opcode in script called OP_RETURN that throws an error if
it is reached.</p>
<p>If you specify a script that has OP_RETURN before the output script,
then the output can’t be spent, since execution terminates before
then.</p>
<p>If this transaction is published on the blockchain, then you’ve
successfully proven that you have destroyed some bitcoin.</p>
<p>No one can ever spend that bitcoin again, since you’ve burned it.</p>
<p>Below OP_RETURN, there’s space to put whatever you want.</p>
<p>One thing you can do with this concept of burning bitcoin is that you
could bootstrap an altcoin, requiring that you must destroy some
Bitcoin, and show a proof of this, in order to get some altcoin.</p>
<p>Some altcoins such as CalCoin do this.</p>
<p>Aside from using OP_RETURN for the sake of deriving an altcoin’s
value, you can also write arbitrary data into the blockchain.</p>
<p>Under OP_RETURN, there’s space to write whatever you want, so people
have been creative with this.</p>
<p>You could potentially prove the existence of something at a
particular point in time.</p>
<p>For example, if you coined a new word, and wanted to prove in the
future that you had coined this word in the past, you could simply burn
this data into the blockchain.</p>
<p>As we mentioned before, the Bitcoin blockchain is immutable, meaning
that it cannot be changed realistically.</p>
<p>Transactions are also timestamped, so people can see that you had
actually coined this word in the past.</p>
<p>Aside from words, you could also prove the existence of a document, a
piece of music, other creative works, or anything else, so long as you
have bitcoin to burn.</p>
<h3 id="intro-advanced-bitcoin-script-and-p2sh">Intro: Advanced Bitcoin
Script and P2SH</h3>
<p>In this section, we’ll look at how to create arbitrary scripts in a
scheme called P2SH, or Pay to Script Hash.</p>
<p>For a better understanding, we’ll compare pay to script hash to the
scheme from the previous section: pay to pub key hash.</p>
<p>To make for a better mental model, we’ll be explaining everything in
terms of a vendor-customer scenario, where the customer creates a
transaction to pay the vendor.</p>
<p>In other words, the customer is the sender, and the vendor is the
recipient.</p>

&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image157.png” alt=” “&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So as a recap, in Bitcoin, senders specify a locking script in the
output of the transaction they are sending, and recipients provide an
unlocking script in the input whenever they want to redeem their
bitcoin.</p>
<p>In the previous section, we gave the example of Pay to Pub Key Hash,
or P2PKH.</p>
<p>In this scheme, the vendor, or the recipient of the transaction,
says: “Send your coins to the hash of this Public Key.”</p>
<p>And later, the vendor has to provide a public key and a signature, in
order to redeem these bitcoins.</p>
<p>This is by far the simplest and most common case.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is the more flexible Pay to Script Hash.</p>
<p>Rather than paying to just a public key hash, we can now pay to a
more complicated set of instructions.</p>
<p>In this scheme, the vendor says: “Send your coins to the hash of this
Script.</p>
<p>I’ll provide the script and the data to make the script evaluate to
true when I redeem the coins.”</p>
<p>This makes sense because we don’t really want vendors to require
customers to create a complicated output script first.</p>
<p>It’s much more customer friendly if the recipient of the transaction,
the vendor, specifies the script.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>As a refresher, here’s how everything works in Pay to Pub Key
Hash.</p>
<p>If Bob wants to receive bitcoin from Alice, Alice has to have access
to Bob’s public key hash.</p>
<p>She can then send a transaction paying to Bob’s public key hash.</p>
<p>In order for Bob to redeem the bitcoin that Alice just sent him, he
must provide a signature and full public key, proving his identity and
allowing him to spend from this transaction output.</p>
<p>Now let’s say that Bob wants to introduce some more functionality
into his transaction with Alice.</p>
<p>Say he wants to use multisig or a time-lock – two types of scripts
that we’ll introduce later.</p>
<p>Instead of providing Alice a public key hash, Bob first creates a
script, takes the hash of it, and sends it off to Alice.</p>
<p>Alice can then send a transaction paying to Bob’s script hash.</p>
<p>In order for Bob to redeem the bitcoin that Alice just sent him, he
must provide a signature and the full script that he had written.</p>

<p>So why Pay to Script Hash instead of just pay to a script?</p>
<p>By providing a hash of the script to the customer, the vendor
offloads the complicated task of having to compose a bitcoin script to
himself.</p>
<p>This is particularly helpful from a vendor-customer standpoint, where
the vendor is the recipient of bitcoin, and the customer is the
sender.</p>
<p>Let’s say a vendor wants to receive money and use complicated
features such as multisignature, they don’t want to burden their
customers by forcing them to write complicated scripts just to make a
transaction.</p>
<p>Therefore, all P2SH requires is for sender to use only hash of the
script to compose a locking script.</p>
<p>The customer doesn’t care what the script actually is – all they care
about is getting their goods.</p>
<p>It’s up to the vendor that they write the correct output script so
that they and ONLY they are able to redeem that output.</p>
<p>It also makes sense that the customer shouldn’t need to know anything
about how the vendor holds their funds in order to be able to easily
send them money.</p>
<p>Pay to Script Hash was an update to Bitcoin back in 2012, and since
then has been one of the most important improvements to Bitcoin since
Bitcoin’s inception.</p>
<h3 id="multisignature">Multisignature</h3>
<p><img src="/images/image160.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81677in" /></p>
<p>One of the most widely used example of P2SH is multisignature, where
a specific number of pre-specified signatures are required to unlock a
UTXO.</p>
<p>A typical multisig scheme is an m-of-n, where you need m of n
signatures users to sign off on a transaction before it is considered
valid.</p>
<p>Some unique benefits of multisig are…First, multisig scheme increases
the difficulty of stealing funds.</p>
<p>Instead of using one private key to unlock the fund, the thief now
has to have the minimum number of keys that satisfies the multisignature
requirements.</p>
<p>Second, using multiple keys to unlock accounts prevents losses.</p>
<p>Before using multisig, losing the one and only bitcoin private key
would be an end-all-be-all situation.</p>
<p>Now, with a 2-of-4 address, for example, you can still redeem the
funds within the address by only having to provide signatures from 2
keys.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it can also be used to give control of a single address to
multiple people.</p>
<p>For instance, the executive board of a company can mandate that 3 out
of 5 executives must approve of a budget before a fund can be spent, and
using a 3-of-5 signature suits the exact purpose.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the diagram on the slide to see how a
multisignature script is constructed and executed.</p>
<p>In the first box of the left hand side diagram, you see the unlocking
script, which contains a number of signatures that are just enough to
satisfy the conditions of the locking script which allows the user to
spend the UTXO.</p>
<p>Below the unlocking script is the redeeming script, which contains
all possible and eligible signatures to spending the bitcoins.</p>
<p>It sets the rules on how and who can spend money from a particular
account.</p>
<p>The letter m on the top of the box represents the minimum number of
signatures, and the letter n shows the total number of valid
signatures.</p>
<p>This redeeming script is only revealed and used when the redeemer
wants to spend the money.</p>
<p>The redeeming script is then hashed, to check against the redeeming
script hash, and evaluated.</p>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image161.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81677in" /></p>
<p>Lastly, if you look at the bottom of the diagram, the locking script
contains the hash against which the hash of the redeem script will later
be compared with.</p>
<p>For a multisig transaction to be valid, the full redeem script is
hashed and then compared with the script hash.</p>
<p>If they match, the UTXO is unlocked.</p>
<h3 id="timelocks">Timelocks</h3>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image162.png" style="width:5in;height:2.85253in" /></p>
<p>Timelocks are a type of functionality in Bitcoin that restrict the
spending of funds until a later time or a specific block height.</p>
<p>Time in this case can either be represented as a UNIX timestamp,
block height, or the number of blocks built on top of the block
containing the transaction.</p>
<p>Timelocks can be absolute or relative.</p>
<p>Absolute timelocks specify an absolute point in the future when a
particular transaction can go through.</p>
<p>This is done using a UNIX timestamp or blockheight.</p>
<p>Relative timelocks on the other hand specify a block depth, or the
number of blocks that have been built on top of current one.</p>
<p>There is also the distinction between transaction-level and
script-level or UTXO-level timelocks.</p>
<p>As their names imply, transaction-level timelocks impose a timelock
on the transaction itself, whereas script-level timelocks can impose
timelocks on specific UTXOs, and are specified in Bitcoin scripts.</p>
<p>Transaction-level timelocks were the first implementation of
timelocks on bitcoin.</p>
<p>This timelock ensures that a transaction cannot not be included in a
valid block until a particular time in the future.</p>
<p>However, the caveat is that since the timelock is only placed on the
transaction but not the UTXO that is being spent, the sender could
simply send another transaction spending from the same UTXO as the
timelocked transaction.</p>
<p>This new transaction will go through first so long as the first
transaction is still timelocked.</p>
<p>And so long as it is valid, the new transaction in effect invalidates
and overrides the timelocked transaction, since the outputs that the
timelocked transaction tries to spend from will have already been used,
thereby cancelling out the original timelocked transaction.</p>
<p>In order to prevent this caveat, the time lock can also be placed on
the UTXO itself.</p>
<p>The UTXO- level timelock specifies that a particular UTXO cannot be
spent until the specified time.</p>
<p>This ensures that the sender of the UTXO cannot override the
transaction by sending the UTXO to another address before the timelock
is unlocked.</p>
<p>One note when using timelocks is that users must be careful near the
expiry time of a timelock.</p>
<p>There is no notion of global time on the blockchain since peers’
clocks on the network could potentially be off.</p>
<p>Therefore, be wary when using absolute timelocks with UNIX
timestamps.</p>
<p>A transaction that seems ready to spend given that a specific amount
of time has passed might be viewed as premature by others.</p>
<p>Also, blocks are not created at guaranteed intervals either, so any
attempts to cancel out of a timelocked transaction should be made a few
hours before the timelock, specified in blockheight, expires.</p>
<h1 id="lecture-3-summary">Lecture 3 Summary</h1>
<h3 id="i.-cryptographic-hash-functions">I. Cryptographic Hash
Functions </h3>
<p>In this lecture, we dove into the low-level specifics of Bitcoin that
make it work. Bitcoin was innovative because it allowed a decentralized
network to reach consensus. It achieved this via tamper-evidence, which
means although one can modify the information that passes along the
Bitcoin network, it would be obvious that some modification has been
made. This tamper evident system allows us to be sure any update on
Bitcoin is the same for everyone.</p>
<p>We achieve a tamper evident system using cryptographic hash functions
to produce standardized random “fingerprints” of our data. If the data
changes, so will the fingerprints. Cryptographic hash functions do the
following:</p>
<p align="center">
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image163.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.31944in" alt="Cryptographic hash functions" /></p>
<p>Cryptographic hash functions are pseudorandom: although the output
for any given input seems random, the output will remain consistent for
that input.</p>
<p>Important Properties of Cryptographic Hash Functions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Pre-image Resistance: Given H(x), it is computationally difficult
to determine x</p></li>
<li><p>Second-image Resistance: Given x, it is computationally difficult
to find some value x’ such that H(x) == H(x’)</p></li>
<li><p>Collision Resistance: It is computationally difficult to find x
and y such that H(x) == H(y)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These properties produce the Avalanche effect, where even any small
change in the input leads to a significant pseudorandom change in the
output.</p>
<p>The particular hash function Bitcoin uses is SHA256, which takes in
an input of size less than 2^64 bits and produces a 256 bit fix sized
output.</p>
<h3 id="ii.-a-tamper-evident-database">II. A Tamper Evident
Database</h3>
<p>This cryptographic hash function is used to make an entire tamper
evident database in Bitcoin. The Block Header of a block on Bitcoin, is
a hash of many contents within the block, most notably its Merkle Root,
Previous Block Hash, and Nonce fields. The Merkle Root represents a
summary of transactions, the Previous Block Hash represents the
chaining, and the Nonce represents the Proof-of-Work.</p>
<p>The Merkle Root is the head of the Merkle Tree, a binary tree of
hashes of all the previous transactions. The Previous Block Hash
contains the hash of the previous block. Both of these hashes change if
any of the previous transactions or blocks is modified.</p>
<p>The Nonce is the manifestation of the proof-of-work in Bitcoin; it is
a numerical value that must be found to solve the partial preimage hash
puzzle. Miners hash the entire block header (the input) and tweak the
nonce and coinbase until they find an output that solves the hash
puzzle. </p>
<p>Hash puzzles must be:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Computationally Difficult: The solution to the hash puzzle cannot
be easily found</p></li>
<li><p>Parameterizable: The difficulty of the hash puzzle should be
adjustable </p></li>
<li><p>Easily Verifiable: Computers should have to do little work to
ensure the answer is correct</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The difficulty of the hash puzzle in Bitcoin is:</p>
<p>difficulty = difficulty * two weeks / time to mine previous 2016
blocks</p>
<p>Once miners solve the puzzle, they receive bitcoin via a coinbase
transaction. Whenever miners produce a block, they first create a
coinbase transaction, which is the first transaction of the Merkle
Tree.</p>
<p>Using cryptographic hash functions, we ensure previous blocks remain
tamper evident; we now turn our attention to how digital signatures help
us ensure current transactions are tamper evident as well. Public and
Private keys in Bitcoin are generated using Elliptic Curve Digital
Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). ECDSA has three key properties:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Given the encrypted message and the sender’s public key, the
recipient should be able to identify the message origin. Since the
message has been signed by the sender’s private key, the ability to
encode it using the public key demonstrates the original sender has
authorized this message.</p></li>
<li><p>The digital signature scheme must also ensure non-repudiation:
once the sender signs the message, they should not be able to undo
it. </p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the scheme must maintain integrity; since messages are
signed with the private key, they cannot be modified after
signing.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Identity in Bitcoin is derived from private keys, which are generated
randomly. Public keys are the result of Elliptic curve point
multiplication of the private key against a known generator point on the
curve. Given the public key, it is computationally infeasible to arrive
at the private key.</p>
<p>We can apply these concepts of private and public keys to understand
how transactions in Bitcoin work. Spending bitcoin is the act
of <strong>redeeming </strong>previous transaction outputs with a proof
that you are the legitimate redeemer, and then <strong>specifying who
can redeem </strong>the output of the transaction you are now creating,
by encoding that per’s information in your transaction.</p>
<p>A transaction has three main sections:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Metadata: Contains housekeeping data, a unique ID of this
transaction, locktime, and size</p></li>
<li><p>Inputs: Contains a list of previously created UTXOs and proof of
eligibility to redeem this money</p></li>
<li><p>Outputs: Contains a list of new UTXOs that will be sent to new
addresses. These values are locked by a script only the intended
redeemer can unlock.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Bitcoin uses the stack-based, Turing-incomplete language named Script
to create transactions. Locking and Unlocking Scripts are contained in
transaction input and previous transaction output and are used to redeem
the output of a previous transaction and specify requirements for
redeeming transactions, respectively. Senders specify a Locking Script,
and recipients specify an Unlocking Script. In Pay-to-Pub-Key-Hash
(P2PKH), the recipient says “send your coins to the hash of this Public
Key.” In Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH), the recipient says “Send your coins
to the hash of this Script; I will provide the script and the data to
make the script evaluate to true when I redeem the coins.” The latter is
popular among customer-vendor transactions, where the vendor (recipient)
is responsible for writing the script.</p>

<h3 id="hw2-when-hashes-collide">HW2: When Hashes Collide</h3>
<p>Bitcoin operates under certain assumptions, such as an honest
majority of computational power. The assumption we discussed in this
last lecture was that cryptographic hashes are unique, given the
properties of preimage, second preimage, and collision resistance.</p>
<p>Let’s say that you manage to break computer science as we know it and
devise a way to make any input look like your preferred output.
Formally, you can always construct an input y such that you can control
the value of H(y) to be in your favor. You can create collisions at
will. How can you then manipulate the Bitcoin protocol in your favor?
There are several different answers, but you only need to provide one
example.</p>

below. We’ll be grading the responses you paste into the text input.</p>
<h3 id="module-4---bitcoin-in-real-life-wallets-mining-and-more">Module
4 - Bitcoin In Real Life: Wallets, Mining, and More </h3>
<p>We’ve looked at Bitcoin mechanics from both a high and low level,
explaining the primary motivations of why we do what we do in Bitcoin,
and its implementation.</p>
<p>But what about the users?</p>
<p>What does the Bitcoin experience look like from their
perspective?</p>
<p>If I want to get involved sending and receiving Bitcoin, mining, or
running a full node, what does that look like?</p>
<p>The user experience varies greatly depending on your involvement with
Bitcoin, but whether you’re a light user, full node, solo miner, or
running a mining farm, you interface with the Bitcoin network in some
way.</p>
<p>This module will touch upon the various user experiences in the
Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>
<p>We’ll start off with a short discussion on the types of users in
Bitcoin, then move on to wallets as a way to manage your identity.</p>
<p>We’ll then formalize the Bitcoin mining procedure and explore real
world mining endeavors.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ll explore the various ways through which users can
change Bitcoin and its underlying protocol.</p>
<p>While we may primarily only think of miners or casual traders using
exchanges or their own wallet software, there are actually a plethora of
different types of Bitcoin users, each categorized by the different
software that they run, and how they interface with the Bitcoin
network.</p>
<h3 id="key-components">Key Components</h3>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image164.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81789in" /></p>
<p>In our previous discussions about Bitcoin mechanics, we explained
everything from the perspective of a full node and miner: a user with
networking capability to interface with the Bitcoin network, actively
maintains a full up-to-date copy of the Bitcoin blockchain, has a wallet
as a means to manage public and private keys, and mines to support the
network and also to earn a mining reward.</p>
<p>There’s a total of four functions: network routing, mining,
maintaining a full blockchain, and handling wallet services, and our
full node miner contains all of them.</p>
<p>But normal clients don’t need all this functionality.</p>
<p>For example, not every client is a miner.</p>
<p>If my computer isn’t fast enough, I won’t be making a profit mining,
so why bother?</p>
<p>Not every client needs to have the entire blockchain.</p>
<p>If I just want to send bitcoin through my phone, why would I want to
have the 160 plus gigabyte blockchain downloaded?</p>
<p>My phone doesn’t even have that much storage!</p>
<p>Not every client even needs a wallet, especially if they don’t
transact often.</p>
<p>Say you’re just a full node hosting the entire blockchain, but have
no interest trading yourself.</p>
<p>Or you have a separate wallet software.</p>
<p>And finally, as we’ll soon see, not every client needs to be
connected to the Bitcoin network, or even the internet!</p>
<p>In actuality, the distinction between different types of users isn’t
just through these four main functionalities – mining, routing, having a
full blockchain, and key management through wallets – but it does
summarize a lot about the Bitcoin user experience.</p>
<p>Intro: Wallets</p>
<p>The first type of user we’ll be talking about is the most common
Bitcoin user.</p>
<p>Doesn’t have the entire blockchain downloaded, and doesn’t need fancy
functionality.</p>
<p>Just a wallet to help manage keys, and this type of user can send and
receive bitcoins with the rest of the network.</p>
<p>As we’ll soon find out, wallets come in many different shapes and
sizes – hosted on the web, on your computer, digital, or physical.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-of-a-wallet">Purpose of a Wallet</h3>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image165.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81317in" /></p>
<p>As we’ve previously mentioned, Bitcoin is all about granting
real-world entities virtual identities.</p>
<p>Through these Bitcoin identities, we can easily authenticate
ownership and send bitcoins between users.</p>
<p>Also as mentioned previously, the private key is what unlocks a
virtual identity.</p>
<p>It’s what gives access to a Bitcoin address.</p>
<p>But how do we actually protect these private keys?</p>
<p>How do we make sure that we’re not subject to identity theft?</p>
<h3 id="types-of-wallets">Types of Wallets</h3>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image166.png" style="width:5in;height:2.80947in" /></p>
<p>This is where wallets come in.</p>
<p>The primary function of Bitcoin wallets is to keep track of your
identity.</p>
<p>Unlike how we use physical wallets to conveniently hold onto and
store our physical money, our digital Bitcoin wallets don’t actually let
us store bitcoins.</p>
<p>Bitcoin wallets are simply a method of storing and accessing your
private key, which then allows you to spend the corresponding
bitcoin.</p>
<p>Most wallet software will also store, send, receive, and list
transactions for you, since it’s easy for software to do this but not
necessarily for humans.</p>
<p>It would be infeasible to manually keep track of all blockchain
activity involving you.</p>
<p>To take care of this, wallet software will store all relevant
information about the blockchain on your behalf.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-wallets-hot-and-cold">Types of Wallets: Hot and
Cold</h3>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image167.png" style="width:5in;height:2.80344in" /></p>
<p>Wallets come in many forms.</p>
<p>We generally make the distinction between two main categories of
wallets – hot and cold – based on their connectivity to the
internet.</p>
<p>Hot wallets are connected to the internet, and cold storage is
not.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-wallets-hot-wallets">Types of Wallets: Hot Wallets</h3>

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="/images/image168.png" alt="XXX " style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
</p>
<p>Some examples of hot wallets are smartphone apps such as Mycelium and
AirBitz (I personally use AirBitz).</p>
<p>There are also online web wallets such as those hosted on
Blockchain.info and coinbase.com.</p>
<p>And all these are connected to the internet.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-wallets-cold-wallets">Types of Wallets: Cold
Wallets</h3>

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="/images/image143.png" alt="Bitcoin Wallets: Cold Storage" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
</p>
<p>On the flip side, cold storage never touches the internet.</p>
<p>For example, there’s paper wallets, hardware wallets, and brain
wallets.</p>
<p>Paper wallets are literally pieces of paper with your private key
printed on it.</p>
<p>You can generate fancy paper wallets on websites such as
Bitcoinpaperwallet.com and Bitaddress.org.</p>
<p>For maximum security, these websites will ask you to download the
entire website and run them locally, but only after shutting off your
entire internet connection for maximum security.</p>
<p>They also warn of smart printers that cache files that it prints, and
operating systems that might already be compromised.</p>
<p>In situations like these, users of paper wallets suggest using a
dumber old- fashioned printer, and also dedicating an entire new, fresh
computer just for the purpose of printing paper wallets.</p>
<p>This is how far some people take security.</p>
<p>There are also hardware wallets such as Ledger, Trezor, Case, and
Keep Key, which are little devices that plug into your computer or
smartphone via USB or some other method and sign transactions for
you.</p>
<p>The idea is that while your computer may be connected to the
internet, the hardware wallet handles your private key and signs
transactions in a trusted execution environment that runs separately
from your computer and never touches the internet.</p>
<p>And then there’s brain wallets.</p>
<p>Imagine a wallet that is so secure that it’ s practically impossible
to hack. Online web wallets might get hacked, your smartphone or
hardware wallet might get stolen, or your house might burn down and take
with it your paper wallet.</p>
<p>Imagine a wallet that’s immune to all of these disasters AND
more.</p>
<p>Well look no further than your brain, the most secure wallet of them
all.</p>
<p>Simply memorize your private key.</p>
<p>Just kidding.</p>
<p>While it is possible to memorize your raw private key, an easier
alternative would to memorize a collection of words or phrases or a
mnemonic.</p>
<p>The idea is to just have a more easily memorizable set of characters
than your straight up private key.</p>
<p>On the right, you can see that I’ve chosen a list of 12 words.</p>
<p>Multiply, scrap, submit, select, adjust, end, accuse, fuel, nose,
hope, chair, afraid.</p>
<p>After I’ve chosen this set, I would then hash them together to get my
private key.</p>
<p>This way, I can have the security of a brain wallet, having no
physical evidence of my private key and keeping everything in my head,
and also get around memorizing my actual private key.</p>
<p>However, there’s a catch.</p>
<p>Humans aren’t as random as we think, so the words someone chooses for
their brain wallet might easily be guessed – such an attack is called a
dictionary attack.</p>
<p>Dictionary attacks are especially dangerous to those who take their
brain wallet words from a famous quote from a speech or movie or
book.</p>
<p>In general, so long as your words are not closely related, it’s still
expensive and improbable that someone would be able to guess and
successfully dictionary attack your brain wallet.</p>

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="/images/image144" alt="Bitcoin Wallets: Key Stretching" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
</p>
<p>However, for the security minded, to further lessen the probability
of someone being able to guess your brain wallet, you can employ what’s
known as key stretching.</p>
<p>There’s nowhere saying what hash function you have to use to get from
your brain wallet to your private key, nor how many times you’re allowed
to hash – that’s all up to you as the user.</p>
<p>The idea behind key stretching is to hash your brain wallet a large
number of times: say 2^20 or some other huge number.</p>
<p>I take my set of words “multiply, scrap, submit, etc” and I……Hash and
hash and hash it….</p>
<p>Not only will an attacker have to guess your initial set of words,
but they would also have to guess how many times you hashed your set of
words.</p>
<p>Hacking a brain wallet that has been key stretched is exponentially
harder to brute force than a brain wallet that is only hashed once.</p>

</p>
<p>There’s a lot of wallets out there, definitely a lot more than what
we’ve gone over, and that’s why users have to do their own research to
find the wallet that’s best for them.</p>
<p>For example, oftentimes you have to trade off between convenience and
security.</p>
<p>Coinbase.com is very easy to use, but they actually store your
private keys on the cloud, and you never get to see it.</p>
<p>Some people don’t like this because you’re putting trust in a
powerful, trusted third party – Coinbase in this case.</p>
<p>However, others are willing to trade this for the convenience of
having their bitcoin at their fingertips through an easy to use
website.</p>
<p>On the other hand, wallets like Mycelium and Electrum do not hold
anyone’s private keys on the cloud.</p>
<p>Users hold their own private keys and are responsible for their own
funds.</p>
<p>There’s no recourse from these services in case someone loses their
private key.</p>
<p>The benefit of course, is security, since no one else but you
controls your private keys.</p>
<p>However, it’s a huge responsibility and burden, especially for casual
Bitcoin users.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, your choice of wallet is really up to you as
an individual.</p>
<p>Whether you’re more partial to convenience features such as payment
via smartphones and QR codes, or fancy multisignature wallets, or go the
extra mile to use a hardware wallet, print out a paper wallet, or
memorize a brain wallet… it all boils down to your personal needs.</p>
<h3 id="bitcoin-atms">Bitcoin ATMs</h3>
<p>You might be thinking: Alright Rustie, we’ve been talking a lot about
Bitcoin wallets and how to manage your private keys, but how do I get
bitcoins in the first place?</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s not some magic internet money after all.</p>
<p>Well lucky for our students in Berkeley, we actually have Bitcoin
ATMs a couple blocks from campus.</p>
<p>And for all you non-UC Berkeley folks, don’t worry, these are also
available elsewhere!</p>
<p>Bitcoin ATMs are pretty cool.</p>
<p>You first scan your QR code from a smartphone wallet app, or any
other device (or piece of paper) that can display a QR code.</p>
<p>The important thing is that this QR code contains your Bitcoin
address.</p>
<p>You then insert cash, press send, and then bitcoin is sent over!</p>
<p>Just like that!</p>
<p>Some Bitcoin ATMs work a bit differently, and instead of having you
scan your QR code, they simply print out a paper wallet for you after
you’ve paid your equivalent amount through cash, debit, or credit
card.</p>

<!----------------------------- How Do I Get Bitcoin: Exchanges ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="/images/image146-how-do-i-get-bitcoin.png" alt="How Do I Get Bitcoin: Exchanges" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
</p>
<p>You can also get Bitcoin through an exchange, where you can trade
between different types of traditional currency and
cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>For example, you can trade from bitcoin to USD, and from USD to
bitcoin, naturally.</p>
<p>Exchanges are important because they set the price of bitcoin, since
they define the market value.</p>
<p>There are a lot of exchanges, some more reputable than others, so
it’s important to do your own due diligence in choosing which exchange
to use.</p>
<p>For example, there’s the distinction between centralized and
decentralized exchanges.</p>
<p>Centralized exchanges are easy to use and easy to access, but could
pose a risk for your funds.</p>
<p>There have been some infamous hacking incidents over the years.</p>
<p>Think of the Mt. Gox hack and bankruptcy, and also the more recent
BitFinex hack in which approximately 120,000 bitcoins were stolen.</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, it’s never safe to keep your money in
exchanges in the long term.</p>
<p>A lot of people do this, and it’s unfortunate when they lose all
their funds when a hack does occur.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------- How Do I Get Bitcoin: Decentralized Exchanges --------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="/images/image147.png" alt="How Do I Get Bitcoin: Decentralized Exchanges" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
</p>
<p>So naturally, following the trend of decentralizing Everything for
security reasons, we now have decentralized exchanges</p>
<p>They don’t rely on a third party service to hold the customer’s
funds, or do any of the mission critical back end work.</p>
<p>Instead, trades only occur directly between users (think P2P).</p>
<p>Generally this is done by creating proxy tokens, or assets, that
represent certain amount of fiat or crypto currency.</p>
<p>Decentralized exchanges can also be trustless.</p>
<p>You don’t have to trust the security or honesty of the exchange since
the funds are held by you in your personal wallet, and not by a third
party.</p>
<p>Some examples of decentralized exchanges are Bitsquare, Bitshares,
Openledger, NXT, CounterParty, etc.</p>
<p>Decentralized exchanges might not necessarily be better than
centralized exchanges, especially since large centralized exchanges are
generally backed by powerful companies that can invest in high security,
but of course, do your own due diligence.</p>
<h3 id="intro-wallet-mechanics">Intro: Wallet Mechanics</h3>
<p>We now know that wallets help manage your identity: your public and
private keys.</p>
<p>In the case of brain wallets and paper wallets, there’s not much else
to say, since the idea behind them is simple: just write or print out a
copy of your private key, or have some mnemonic or way to derive your
private key.</p>
<p>But when it comes to wallet software, it’s a bit more complex.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll be going into some wallet mechanics and how
they enable the functionality in your favorite Bitcoin wallet app.</p>
<h3 id="simple-payment-verification">Simple Payment Verification</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------ Simple Payment Verification: Thin Clients ----------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="/images/image148.png" alt="Simple Payment Verification: Thin Clients" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
</p>
<p>First off, let’s address the elephant in the room.</p>
<p>How come when I use my wallet software, I don’t have to download the
entire Bitcoin blockchain?</p>
<p>Well, we have SPV to thank for that.</p>
<p>SPV stands for Simple Payment Verification, and it’s a method for
verifying if particular transactions (specifically your own
transactions) are included in a block by only having to download the
blockheaders of each block, instead of the entire block, which includes
all the transactions.</p>
<p>This is particularly useful for clients that are constrained by
storage capacity, as they can now operate without storing the full
blockchain.</p>
<p>Imagine your typical Bitcoin smartphone wallet app.</p>
<p>You don’t have the entire blockchain stored.</p>
<p>Instead, you have a wallet, to keep track of your keys, and a network
routing component that allows you to connect to the Bitcoin p2p
protocol.</p>
<p>This is all done without a full blockchain, and for this reason,
clients that run SPV are called lightweight or thin clients.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------- Simple Payment Verification: Thin Clients: Assumptions --------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="/images/image149.png" alt="Simple Payment Verification: Thin Clients: Assumptions" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
</p>
<p>In SPV, by having the block headers, you can simply run a merkle
proof of inclusion, which we explained in the previous module in the
tamper evident database section.</p>
<p>One major assumption you have to make when using SPV is that incoming
block headers are not from a false chain.</p>
<p>If the block headers you receive are fake or invalid, then a
transaction you see as valid may not actually be so, and someone could
potentially double spend you!</p>
<p>Thankfully, it’s generally ok to assume that incoming block headers
are not from a false chain.</p>
<p>As long as you connect to many different nodes, then the probability
of each one being controlled by one malicious entity is significantly
lowered.</p>
<p>And as long as you’re connected to a variety of nodes, in the long
term, the chain you see will be honest: a core assumption that we make
in Bitcoin to begin with.</p>
<p>And realistically, we can’t afford to put the entire blockchain on
our phones or other lightweight devices, so having a thin client running
SPV is a pretty decent tradeoff.</p>
<h3 id="multisignature-1">Multisignature</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------  ----------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="/images/image150.png" alt="" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
</p>
<p>We mentioned multisignature in the previous module in regards to pay
to script hash, but just to explain again and elaborate on its potential
uses, we generalize, saying that multisig enables what are called M-of-N
transactions.</p>
<p>In simple terms, multisig is a way of cryptographically sharing a key
between participants, and serves to distribute points of failure.</p>
<p>Imagine if you want to share a wallet with your family, or even with
yourself.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------  ----------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="/images/image151.png" alt="" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
</p>
<p>For example, consider a 2-of-3 multisig.</p>
<p>Imagine I have a 2 of 3 multisig with my friends Derrick and
Gloria.</p>
<p>Only two of us need to sign off on a transaction in order to send
it.</p>
<p>But no one can just run off with our bitcoin since you need at least
two of three keys.</p>
<p>And in this example, I have set up a two of three multisig with
myself.</p>
<p>Instead of losing my private key and then subsequently losing all of
my funds, I have more than one point of failure.</p>
<p>After losing one private key, i still have two of the three total
keys, so I still have sufficient keys to access my funds in a 2-of-3
multisig scheme.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------  ----------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="/images/image152.png" alt="" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
</p>
<p>As another example, some exchanges and software wallet companies
provide 2-of-3 or 3-of-5 multisig services.</p>
<p>In the 2-of-3 multisig case, you keep two of your keys, and a trusted
third party such as the company holds the third.</p>
<p>The exchange can’t use your funds since they only have one key, but
if you ever lose one of your keys, the company can step in and offer
their key to help you recover your funds.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, this works similarly for 3-of-5 or any other
M-of-N multisig.</p>
<h3 id="key-generation-best-practices">Key Generation Best
Practices</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------  ----------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="/images/image153.png" alt="" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
</p>
<p>It’s generally considered best practice to never reuse
pseudonyms.</p>
<p>This requires generating a new public and private key pair for every
transaction you make.</p>
<p>You want to do this so that it’s more difficult to determine how much
bitcoin you own, and what you’ve been spending that bitcoin on.</p>
<p>Also, imagine if you didn’t generate a new public and private key
pair for every transaction, and you had all your funds associated with
one identity.</p>
<p>As soon as you lose the corresponding private key, all your funds are
gone.</p>
<p>It’s best practice to spread out your funds across multiple
identities.</p>
<p>After all your private keys are just random numbers – there’s no
relation between them – so compromising one key is independent of the
others.</p>
<p>And public and private keys are computationally easy to generate
anyways, so why wouldn’t you generate new public and private keys for
every transaction?</p>
<p>It’s a little effort that could potentially go along way in saving
your Bitcoin user experience.</p>
<p>Wallet software will generally handle this anyways, making it so much
easier to comply with best practices.</p>
<h3 id="jbok-wallets">JBOK Wallets</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------  ----------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="/images/image153.png" alt="" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
</p>
<p>Now if you’re complying with best practices and generating a new
public and private key for every transaction you make, the natural
question is: how do I manage an increasing number of keys?</p>
<p>This is especially the case if you’re making frequent
transactions.</p>
<p>The number of keys you control can quickly become overwhelming.</p>
<p>The traditional way to keep track of keys was through what are known
as JBOK wallets, where JBOK is an acronym standing for “Just a Bunch of
Keys.”</p>
<p>The idea behind JBOK wallets was that after making every transaction,
you would make a new backup of the new key pair you generate.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could also start off with a bunch of keys
generated beforehand.</p>
<p>However, after you use up all of these keys, you would still have the
same issue of having to generate more keys.</p>
<p>JBOK wallets aren’t too convenient because you have to store each and
every key pair.</p>
<p>Consider if you’re an exchange, and you have thousands of users
trading constantly.</p>
<p>You’d have to deal with so many keys, and even more back ups.</p>
<p>That’d be pretty unmanageable.</p>
<h3 id="hd-wallets">HD Wallets</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------  ----------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="/images/image154.png" alt="" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
</p>
<p>Instead of having just a bunch of keys, let’s try something a bit
more clever.</p>
<p>What if we could instead come up with a way of deriving keys from a
original seed value?</p>
<p>That’s the idea behind HD Wallets, or Hierarchical Deterministic
wallets.</p>
<p>We start off with a randomly generated seed value.</p>
<p>Instead of having to back up every single key from now on, we could
just deterministically generate a new key pair, so long as we know our
original seed.</p>
<p>We can think of this seed as a master key.</p>
<p>We first generate our master key, and for each subsequent key we want
to generate, we can just take the hash of the master key with some
counter or index number, and then we’ll arrive at our derived child
key.</p>
<p>For example, if I want to generate my third child key, I would append
3 to my master key and hash the whole thing.</p>
<p>We can think of the master key as being a parent key, and any keys
that are generated from it are its child keys.</p>
<p>And to make things more interesting, we can also use child keys as
parent keys to generate even more child keys.</p>
<p>By generating keys in a known way instead of randomly, we greatly
lessen the load on wallets having to keep track of all your keys –
especially if you’re dealing with thousands of keys like exchanges
do.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------  ----------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="/images/image155.png" alt="" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
</p>
<p>Of course, exchanges can use HD wallets to greatly reduce their load,
but HD wallets are also useful elsewhere.</p>
<p>Imagine an organization with a hierarchical structure.</p>
<p>Imagine that we have the president control our master key.</p>
<p>From the master key, we can generate child keys for each of the
department heads.</p>
<p>And from the keys of the department heads, we can generate child keys
again for each of the department employees.</p>
<p>Since keys are derived in a hierarchical fashion, someone controlling
a parent key can derive a child key, and can thus spend from it.</p>
<p>In our hierarchical organization, if everyone in the org were to have
an HD wallet as previously defined, then the department heads could
spend from the wallets of employees in their department, since the
employees keys were generated from the department head’s keys.</p>
<p>And the president would have the most power.</p>
<p>Everyone’s key originates in some way from the president’s master
key, so the president would be able to spend from everyone’s wallet.</p>
<h3 id="intro-mining">Intro: Mining</h3>
<p>We’ve talked about consensus and Proof-of-Work, but we haven’t really
talked about the implementation of mining in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In this module, we’ll be diving into the nitty gritty of how mining
manifests in the real world, and how even the brilliant Satoshi Nakamoto
may not have envisioned the future of mining.</p>
<p>We will go through what a miner actually does to validate blocks.</p>
<h3 id="recipe-for-mining-overview">Recipe for Mining: Overview</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------  ----------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="/images/image156.png" alt="" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
</p>
<p>Let’s first take a look at the generic steps for mining as a full
node.</p>
<p>Step 0, the preliminary step for mining, is downloading the entire
Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p>This allows us to know the history so that we can verify future
transactions.</p>
<p>Note: this step is optional if you mine in a mining pool; we’ll talk
more about this later.</p>
<p>Step 1, the next step, is to verify transactions, which we fill up
our block with valid transactions.</p>
<p>Step 2, create the block using the given transactions, and all
necessary metadata, such as time, version, and target.</p>
<p>Step 3, find the proof-of-work, aka a valid nonce that solves the
partial preimage hash puzzle.</p>
<p>Step 4, broadcast your block if you have not seen any competitor
blocks yet.</p>
<p>Step 5, if your block gets included in the longest chain: profit!</p>
<p>Let’s go into detail on how each of these steps plays out.</p>
<h3 id="recipe-for-mining-step-0">Recipe for Mining: Step 0</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------  ----------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="/images/image157.png" alt="" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
</p>
<p>Step 0, download the history of transactions.</p>
<p>This is Step 0 for two reasons: It only needs to be done once.</p>
<p>Once you have the full Bitcoin blockchain history, you don’t need to
redownload that info; you only need to keep track of incoming blocks
from other miners.</p>
<p>If you’re a miner with an SPV node, you only need to store the block
headers and request info from full nodes for verifying transactions as
needed.</p>
<p>Meaning that this step is optional.</p>
<p>We’ll describe further different types of miners.</p>
<p>If you want to be a full, independent miner though, you have to do
this step.</p>
<p>Now that we have the full history, let’s go ahead and get started
with mining!</p>
<h3 id="recipe-for-mining-step-1">Recipe for Mining: Step 1</h3>

</p>
<h3 id="step-1-verify-transactions.">Step 1, verify transactions.</h3>
<p>Bitcoin users are sending transactions to the Bitcoin network every
second, and it’s the miners’ jobs to verify the validity of those
transactions.</p>
<p>As transactions come to the miner, they will store those in a
“mempool,” where “mem” means “memory” and “pool” means supply (referring
to supply of transactions).</p>
<p>It’s where all the pending transactions live before they make their
way into a block.</p>
<p>Miners will then choose transactions to verify based on their
transaction fees, which we’ll get into shortly.</p>
<p>They verify the validity of each by running the unlocking script as
mentioned in Lecture 3.</p>
<p>If that piece of code is able to successfully unlock the previous
bitcoins, then the transaction goes through.</p>
<h3 id="recipe-for-mining-step-2">Recipe for Mining: Step 2</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------  ----------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="/images/image159.png" alt="" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
</p>
<p>After validating all these transactions, it’s time to generate a
block.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, there are several pieces of information
necessary to construct a block, For example, the Merkle Root, which we
generate from our list of transactions.</p>
<p>After constructing the block data, we are finally able to start
working on the most expensive part of the mining process, the step that
earned this whole process of Proof-of-Work the “mining” title: finding a
valid nonce.</p>
<h3 id="recipe-for-mining-step-3">Recipe for Mining: Step 3</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------  ----------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="/images/image160.png" alt="" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
</p>
<p>As mentioned before, every miner needs to find a nonce which makes
the hash of the block header less than some target value.</p>
<p>This is how we implement Proof-of-Work in Bitcoin and every other
Proof-of-Work cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>By finding the nonce, we have translated the energy burned in
computation directly into voting power in the Proof-of-Work consensus
protocol.</p>
<p>You may have noticed in this pseudocode that there are two different
nonces, the header nonce and the coinbase nonce.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the nonce in the header is a reasonably small
number: only a 32 bit number.</p>
<p>This means that a powerful device can run through all the nonce
possibilities within a second.</p>
<p>To make it such that we don’t reach a dead end with our mining
puzzle, we need to change our puzzle if the header nonce has no viable
options.</p>
<p>To do this, we change the coinbase nonce, a field within the coinbase
transaction.</p>
<p>By changing this nonce, we change the Merkle Root, and therefore,
we’re able to explore more options and hopefully find the answer to the
mining puzzle.</p>
<p>Our mining puzzle is completely different.</p>
<p>We go through these loops until finally we find a valid nonce.</p>
<h3 id="recipe-for-mining-step-4">Recipe for Mining: Step 4</h3>

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="/images/image161.png" alt="Recipe for Mining: Find a Valid Nonce" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
</p>
<p>After finding the nonce, the typical miner broadcasts it as soon as
possible so that other miners are aware that a block was found.</p>
<p>Those miners will validate the block for themselves before accepting
it into their own chain, and then broadcast the block once more.</p>
<p>By broadcasting the block first, other miners will abandon their
previous blocks and start to mine on this new longest chain.</p>
<p>At least, that’s the hope: there’s the possibility that someone else
broadcasted a block before you that you haven’t yet seen!</p>
<p>Only if your block makes its way into the longest chain will you reap
the rewards.</p>
<p>So how do we ensure that happens?</p>
<p>Well, we can’t!</p>
<p>All we can do is hope that we got lucky.</p>
<p>That’s all Proof-of-Work really is at its base, a random lottery.</p>
<h3 id="recipe-for-mining-step-5">Recipe for Mining: Step 5</h3>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="/images/image162.png" alt="" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
</p>
<p>Assuming that our block made its way into the longest chain, we
profit!</p>
<p>We receive both the block reward, represented by the coinbase
transactions, and transaction fees.</p>
<p>All the transactions within that block are added to the canon
transaction history.</p>
<p>A situation in which our block is not in the longest chain is where
our block is competing with another block that was submitted to the
network at the same time.</p>
<p>In which case, miners will likely choose randomly between the two,
meaning that it’s once again luck.</p>
<p>If your block is orphaned, or in a fork that’s not the longest chain,
then you get no profit.</p>
<p>We won’t actually ever be 100% certain that our block is in the
longest chain.</p>
<p>We just assume that the probability of a fork happening gets lower
over time.</p>
<p>We’ll talk about that more in the game theory lecture.</p>

<h3 id="mining-incentives-intro">Mining Incentives: Intro</h3>
<p>So why do we do things?</p>
<p>Why do we work at a job?</p>
<p>Why do we trade cryptocurrencies?</p>
<p>Why do you choose to watch these lectures?</p>
<p>Well, it’s a pretty simple answer:</p>
<p>Profit!</p>
<p>Let me make that a little bigger for you.</p>
<p>Yes, profit!</p>
<p>As you know intuitively, everything that anyone does is with the
expectation of gaining some profit.</p>
<p>Each person’s definition of profit is different, but it’s pretty
straightforward in Bitcoin: more money means more profit.</p>
<p>It’s such a simple word, yet this concept of profit will come up
again and again throughout the rest of this course.</p>
<p>In fact, any type of incentive mechanisms within blockchain protocols
focus on aligning personal profit with overall profit.</p>
<p><img src="/images/image195.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8368in" /></p>
<p>Pay good attention to this slide.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s very basic information, but this equation is fundamental to
all incentive structures.</p>
<p>It is the fact that the profit equals revenue minus cost.</p>
<p>This means that, only if the revenue exceeds the cost, will you get
profit.</p>
<p>Every single person in the Bitcoin network is presumably maximizing
the value of their own profit to the best of their ability.</p>
<h3 id="mining-incentives-block-reward">Mining Incentives: Block
Reward</h3>
<p><img src="/images/image196.png" style="width:5in;height:2.82562in" /></p>
<p>Let’s go ahead and break down the various components of profit within
Bitcoin.</p>
<p>First, we’ll start by discussing the block reward, the most
significant source of profit currently for miners.</p>
<p><img src="/images/image197.png" style="width:5in;height:2.86645in" /></p>
<p>The block reward is a reward that goes to a miner whose block is
included in the longest chain.</p>
<p>As of May 2018, the block reward is around 12.5 bitcoins.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the miner includes a special transaction to
themselves: the coinbase transaction.</p>
<p>That transaction is what both allows for the minting of bitcoins and,
more importantly, incentivizes honest actors to validate blocks.</p>
<p>To understand better the rationale for the block reward, remember
that profit is the primary motivator for any activity, and that a higher
incentive for honest behavior leads to a more secure network.</p>
<p>However, we can’t directly punish dishonest behavior: everyone’s
anonymous, and there’s no effective way to enforce punishment.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that, if we can’t punish dishonest behavior, we
might as well reward honest behavior!</p>
<p>Because miners get rewarded for producing blocks, they’re
incentivized to produce more blocks.</p>
<p>However, they only get rewarded in bitcoins.</p>
<p>This means that, if a miner sees no value in Bitcoin, they are less
likely to spend money on electricity and hardware to get bitcoins.</p>
<p>Because of this, we expect honest mining power to be drawn more
heavily to the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>As you notice on the graph, the Bitcoin supply cap tapers off at a
certain point, calculated at 21 million.</p>
<p>This is because the block reward halves every 210,000 (two hundred
and ten thousand) blocks, which is approximately 4 years.</p>
<p>It started off at 50 bitcoins per block when Bitcoin first started,
then it dropped to 25 after the first two years, and has been halving
ever since.</p>
<p>By using a geometric series, the supply cap is calculated to be 21
million bitcoins.</p>
<p>One caveat about this: Not all 21 million bitcoins will be
liquid.</p>
<p>For example, approximately 1 million belongs to Satoshi Nakamoto, and
it is possible that those bitcoins will never move.</p>
<p>In addition, some private keys have been lost, and some bitcoins have
been burned, all decreasing the usable supply cap.</p>
<h3 id="mining-incentives-transaction-fees">Mining Incentives:
Transaction Fees</h3>
<p><img src="/images/image198.png" style="width:5in;height:2.91123in" /></p>
<p>Now that we’ve talked about block rewards, let’s go ahead and talk
about transaction fees.</p>
<p>Transaction fees are the second form of profit for miners.</p>
<p>The transaction fee is a price set by the sender of a
transaction.</p>
<p>You can consider the transaction fee the cost of service for using
the power of the bitcoin network.</p>
<p>Providing transaction fees are not required for a transaction to go
through, but they incentivize miners to consider choosing your
transaction over other ones due to limited block space.</p>
<p>Because a miner can only approve so many transactions at once given
the one megabyte size limit, they will want to choose the transactions
that give them the most profit within that block.</p>
<p>In fact, the way the miner calculates the transactions they will
collect into a block is through maximizing the ratio of transaction fees
to unit of storage.</p>
<p>What this means is that the overall transaction fees for their block
will be maximized as they’re taking all the most profitable
transactions.</p>
<p>Notice one thing as the block reward diminishes, transaction fees
will go up if miners seek the same amount of profit in bitcoins.</p>
<p>As block rewards approach zero, transaction fees will become the
primary source of revenue for miners.</p>
<h3 id="mining-costs-fixed-costs">Mining Costs: Fixed Costs</h3>
<p><img src="/images/image199.png" style="width:5in;height:2.80884in" /></p>
<p>Now that we’ve discussed all the different sources of revenue for
miners, we can move on to the costs.</p>
<p>Let’s start off by discussing the fixed costs, and then get into the
variable costs after.</p>
<p>As you all know, hardware is what allows users to mine, and the cost
of hardware is fixed.</p>
<p>It’s a one-time purchase.</p>
<p>There are a few different types of hardware, ranging from generic
computation devices to specialized mining hardware.</p>
<p>This logarithmically scaled graph here shows a quick overview of the
growth of mining power produced by miners, which as you can tell has
grown incredibly, several orders of magnitude since the start of
Bitcoin.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-hardware">Types of Hardware</h3>
<p><img src="/images/image200.png" style="width:5in;height:2.89531in" /></p>
<p>The first type of mining hardware used was a CPU, or central
processing unit.</p>
<p>As of late September 2017, mining with a CPU would take you about 7.6
million years to find a block.</p>
<p>This is because there is much more powerful hardware nowadays, which
makes it much harder for a CPU to compete with the rest of the
network.</p>
<p>The pseudocode above is what was run originally by CPU miners.</p>
<p>They were the original type of computing power available to the
general public.</p>
<p>This is because CPUs are meant to do generic computation, but they
are not great at specifically calculating hashes.</p>
<p>Some members of the gaming community quickly recognized that they had
some more powerful computation devices available at their hands:
GPUs.</p>
<p>GPUs, or graphic processing units, are devices typically used for
processing images, like video games.</p>
<p>These devices are also generic computational devices in that they can
handle many different types of computation, including hashing.</p>
<p>They are an order of magnitude faster than CPUs when it comes to
computing, meaning that they can hash 10 times as fast.</p>
<p>If you look in the chart, you’ll see that in order to mine a block,
GPUs only take about a mere 762 thousands years!</p>
<p>GPU miners were most common about 6 years ago, back in 2012, when
still not many people had heard of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>They were repurposed from gaming to mining, providing GPU miners a
significant advantage above CPU miners.</p>
<p>Some of the disadvantages of using GPUs, however, stems from their
components irrelevant to mining.</p>
<p>For example, mining does not require any floating point numbers, so
the excess components are not helpful but are still included in the cost
of GPU hardware.</p>
<p>In addition, they are not meant to be run in farms side by side, so
it is difficult to operate a large scale GPU mining setup.</p>
<p><img src="/images/image201.png" style="width:5in;height:2.87528in" /></p>
<p>This is where FPGAs, or Field Programmable Gate Arrays, come into
play.</p>
<p>These were the first forms of specialized mining hardware in
Bitcoin.</p>
<p>These devices were optimized for mining Bitcoin, but they did not
lose all general computation power.</p>
<p>The reason for this tradeoff was because there was still some
uncertainty around Bitcoin’s future success, and Bitcoin-specific
hardware would become useless if Bitcoin disappeared.</p>
<p>However, if Bitcoin thrives, then there is a desire to beat out other
mining competition.</p>
<p>However, FPGAs were only used briefly, because much more powerful
hardware quickly came into the market around 2014.</p>
<p><img src="/images/image202.png" style="width:5in;height:2.86957in" /></p>
<p>ASICs, or Application Specific Integrated Circuits, are mentioned
throughout the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>
<p>These are fully specialized devices that can do only one thing.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ASICs are capable of one type of computation alone:
mining.</p>
<p>These devices do nothing but solve the Bitcoin hash puzzle, but they
do it better than anything else.</p>
<p>There are large amounts of customizability when it comes to
ASICs.</p>
<p>These range from choosing a lower base cost in exchange for higher
electricity use, or choosing a smaller device and losing out on
hashrate.</p>
<p>Depending on your specific needs, there probably exists a relevant
ASIC.</p>
<p>One issue with ASICs, however, is their initial cost.</p>
<p>Not only do ASICs take a lot of upfront capital to produce, but they
also need to be bought in tremendous batches to make a reasonable
profit.</p>
<p>A fun stat: one of the most popular and powerful ASICs, the Antminer
S9, can perform 14 trillion hashes per second but would still take about
10.9 years to find a block.</p>
<h3 id="mining-costs-operating-costs">Mining Costs: Operating Costs</h3>
<p><img src="/images/image203.png" style="width:5in;height:2.85403in" /></p>
<p>Now that we’ve discussed fixed costs, or hardware costs, let’s finish
up the equations with an understanding of the variable costs in
mining.</p>
<p>As we know, there’s several different costs of energy consumed in the
process of mining, all of which are considerations for the cost of
Bitcoin on the environment.</p>
<p><img src="/images/image204.png" style="width:5in;height:2.83991in" /></p>
<p>These energy costs come in multiple forms, but primarily the
following three.</p>
<p>Embodied energy is consumed when producing hardware, electricity
powers hardware, and cooling maintains hardware as it heats up.</p>
<p>All these types of energy are considerations, but electricity and
cooling are the variable energy costs that are the bigger considerations
when looking at long-term profit projections.</p>
<p>On top of that, there is infrastructure and overhead to maintain as
well, such as space and employees.</p>
<p>Depending on the scale of your operation, you may need to go so far
as to purchase entire warehouses and a few maintainers to ensure that
nothing goes wrong with the hardware, or to take care of things when
hardware goes down.</p>
<p><img src="/images/image205.png" style="width:5in;height:2.84324in" /></p>
<p>Finally, you understand everything there is to know about how to
profit from mining.</p>
<p>If you keep your revenue above your costs, you’ll make a profit from
mining!</p>
<p>Keep in mind that most mining operations, don’t turn a profit for
quite a while, so do much more research before spinning up your own ASIC
farm.</p>
<p>Speaking of ASIC farms, we’ll go ahead and examine what some mining
operations look like in the real world in the next section.</p>
<h3 id="intro-real-world-mining">Intro: Real World Mining</h3>
<p>We’ve seen and understood mining from the theoretical and technical
side, but what does it look like in practice?</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll see what mining operations look like in the
real world.</p>
<p>Theory and practice often differ in a lot of scenarios, and this is
definitely the case in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>We’ll see that while the initial goal of Bitcoin was to be
decentralized, honoring the “one CPU one vote” mantra, this could not be
farther from the truth.</p>
<h3 id="asics">ASICs</h3>
<p><img src="/images/image206.png" style="width:5in;height:2.84326in" /></p>
<p>Here, we see a few pictures of what an ASIC mining farm in China.</p>
<p>As you can see, the look is very industrial.</p>
<p>This is because the farm focuses on reducing unnecessary costs, which
increases profit for the miners.</p>
<p>The racks are for systematic allocation of hardware, and the giant
fans are for cooling.</p>
<p>Notice the water cooling used in the bottom right image.</p>
<p>Anyone familiar with hardware maintenance will recognize that water
cooling is much more expensive than air cooling, meaning that whoever is
cooling their devices with water cooling is willing to take a bigger
cost for better maintenance of their hardware.</p>
<p>Perhaps in the long run, better maintenance means that there’s less
need to replace hardware.</p>
<p>Either way, the goal of each of these mining farms is to maximize
their profit.</p>
<p>This is why places that are cold – hence providing natural cooling –
or that provide cheap electricity are more advantageous to set up a long
term mining operation.</p>
<p>Here is an example of an ASIC.</p>
<p>[asic goes here]</p>
<p>The machine on the left is an Antminer S9, with 14 trillion hashes
per second.</p>
<p>It’s one of the most powerful ASICs on the market currently.</p>
<p>The company that produces these, BITMAIN, claims that it has provided
approximately 70% of the world’s mining power in hardware.</p>
<p>On the right we can see racks and racks of Antminer S9’s in a
datacenter.</p>
<p>This particular photo was taken from an online listing that rented
out Antminer S9’s by the month.</p>
<p>But of course, even with the most impressive technology, it still
takes far too long to find a block.</p>
<p>Is there any way that we can reduce the amount of time it takes for
us to get profit from our hardware?</p>
<h3 id="mining-pools">Mining Pools</h3>
<p><img src="/images/image207.png" style="width:5in;height:2.84715in" /></p>
<p>Well, that’s where mining pools come in.</p>
<p>Mining pools allow individual miners to join their hash power
together.</p>
<p>This way, they will collectively find blocks and get rewards more
often, even if they only get a smaller amount with each block the pool
finds.</p>
<p>Mining pools are run by a pool manager, or pool operator, that takes
care of running a Bitcoin full node and distributing jobs to other
miners.</p>
<p>They also take a cut of the rewards as compensation.</p>
<p>This way, miners don’t even have to store the blockchain themselves:
similar to cloud computing, they give pools access to their hardware in
exchange for a share of profits from the pool.</p>
<p>You may be asking, “Bitcoin is decentralized! How can I prove to a
pool that I’m spending computation power to help them out?”</p>
<p>Remember something really neat: this problem is a smaller version of
the problem Bitcoin itself solved!</p>
<p>We can have miners prove that they’re doing work for the pool through
shares.</p>
<p>Shares are defined as near-valid or valid blocks.</p>
<p>Here’s how that works:</p>
<p>Let’s say I’m in Berkeley Pool, the hypothetical UC Berkeley mining
pool.</p>
<p>My miner just found a block hash with half as many leading zeros as a
valid block.</p>
<p>This is an unlikely event that resulted from expending a significant
amount of computational resources.</p>
<p>Mining pools can use this information to gauge just how much mining
power you’re contributing, and they can reward you for valid shares.</p>
<p>That way, I can get paid by BerkeleyPool even if I never find a valid
block, because these near-valid blocks are indicators that I’m at least
trying to find a valid block.</p>
<p>This is how we can create mining pools through Bitcoin.</p>
<p>On top of that, we know that no miner in the mining pool can just
take the rewards for themselves.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that rewards are given out through the coinbase
transaction.</p>
<p>In mining pools, the puzzle you are trying to solve contains a
coinbase transaction that pays the pool manager the block reward.</p>
<p>And then the pool manager would hopefully redistribute the block
reward.</p>
<p>Miners are solving a problem based on the Merkle Root, since they’re
hashing everything in the block header.</p>
<p>And the Merkle Root of the block is based on the coinbase
transaction.</p>
<p>If a miner wants to get rewards for themselves, they’d have to change
the coinbase transaction to redirect the block rewards to
themselves.</p>
<p>Thus, they wouldn’t get any shares from the mining pool, since the
mining pool manager would see that the miner’s coinbase transaction does
not pay to the manager’s address.</p>
<h3 id="mining-pool-schemes">Mining Pool Schemes</h3>
<p><img src="/images/image208.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8268in" /></p>
<p>There are various schemes for payout that mining pool use.</p>
<p>The two most fundamental categories are Pay-per-Share and
Proportional.</p>
<p>You can probably gather the basic ideas from the names.</p>
<p>Pay-per-share schemes will pay you a fixed amount of money for each
share.</p>
<p>This payment is guaranteed and constant per share, regardless of how
much reward the pool makes.</p>
<p>Most pools use this scheme, as it’s easy to implement and to
understand.</p>
<p>As you can tell, this is more advantageous for the miner, as variance
of their payout is reduced.</p>
<p>This implies that pools take on more risk because they will incur
costs if blocks aren’t found by the pool.</p>
<p>On top of that, there’s no incentive for a miner to actually submit
valid blocks to the pool.</p>
<p>We’ll see why this is an issue in the Game Theory lecture.</p>
<p>Proportional schemes are the other category which pay out only when a
block is found.</p>
<p>The reward of each miner is proportional to the number of shares
submitted before the block was found.</p>
<p>This is more advantageous for the pool, as they’ll never pay out more
money than they have, but it leads to more variance and risk for
miners.</p>
<p>Because of the difficulty of buy-in, proportional schemes aren’t seen
often, if ever, in the mining world.</p>
<p><img src="/images/image209.png" style="width:5in;height:2.80409in" /></p>
<p>This is a demonstration of several different payout schemes that have
been thought of.</p>
<p>The point is that there are many ways to go about paying miners, and
each one has a different set of incentive tradeoffs.</p>
<p>It all depends on the size and assumptions of the mining pool.</p>
<h3 id="mining-pool-pros-and-cons">Mining Pool Pros and Cons</h3>
<p><img src="/images/image210.png" style="width:5in;height:2.84004in" /></p>
<p>So now that we’re familiar with mining pool schemes, we can talk
about the pros and cons of mining pools.</p>
<p>The pros of mining pools are that they give individual and smaller
miners the opportunity to make profit without waiting decades to get
payment.</p>
<p>On top of that, software changes are easy to make.</p>
<p>Only one person is running a full node for the mining pool, and that
person can upgrade on behalf of the pool.</p>
<p>Cons include trust in the pool manager.</p>
<p>You have to rely on them not to misuse your mining power and not to
withhold rewards.</p>
<p>This is a consequence of centralization.</p>
<p>On top of that, a multitude of attacks are enabled by mining pools,
which we will discuss further in the Game Theory lecture.</p>
<p>The community typically dislikes large mining pools.</p>
<p><img src="/images/image211.png" style="width:5in;height:2.80108in" /></p>
<p>For example, GHash.io once approached 50% of the network mining
power.</p>
<p>Miners within GHash voluntarily pulled out of the mining pool because
they were aware of the dangers of approaching 51% of the network.</p>
<p>In addition, another concern is that a single entity might be hiding
their total amount of mining power.</p>
<p>We see here that BTC.com has about 29% of the mining power in their
pool, but what’s to stop them from submitting hashpower to other
pools?</p>
<p>This is known as laundering hashes, by hiding the origin of mining
power.</p>
<p>This allows you to leverage great amounts of mining power without
revealing your prowess to the community.</p>
<p>By doing so, you experience no backlash while still receiving major
profits.</p>
<p>Because of this, the graph is only a high-level estimate.</p>
<p>We don’t know the true concentration of control over mining hardware,
and we may never know.</p>
<h3 id="mining-pool-stats">Mining Pool Stats</h3>
<p><img src="/images/image212.png" style="width:5in;height:2.80725in" /></p>
<p>This will be a rundown to show the contrast between solo mining and
pool mining.</p>
<p>We’ll show an interesting paradox which you may have noticed: more
mining power leads to centralization.</p>
<p>So today’s network hashrate according to blockchain.info is
33,971,919 TH/s (about 34 million).</p>
<p>Mining reward is currently 12.5 BTC per block, and since blocks are
mined every 10 minutes on average, we can calculate that the total
mining reward yearly is 657,000 BTC/yr. (six hundred fifty seven
thousand)</p>
<p>Also, for the sake of this calculation, we assume that the price of
bitcoin is constant, staying at 10,000 USD</p>
<p>Suppose you want to start solo mining today.</p>
<p>First you need to buy your mining hardware, and let’s you’re buying a
Antminer S9, which costs 3000 dollars with a hash rate of 14 TH/s.</p>
<p>Your hashrate in relation to the entire network’s hashrate is very
small.</p>
<p>If we do the math, you end up having 0.0000004% of the total network
hash power.</p>
<p>You expected annual reward in this case would be 2707 dollar per
year, and this is just an estimate of your average income.</p>
<p>However, if you are unlucky, you might end up with not finding a
block in a very long time.</p>
<p>Taking into account the variance of having such small proportion of
the network hash rate, we can see that with our current numbers, we can
expect to mine 1 block every 2,426,566 (about 2.4 million) blocks, which
translates to a reward of approximately $125,000 once every 46.2
years</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you were to mine with a pool, you could expect
to have much more regular payouts.</p>
<p>Assuming a pool you choose to join has one sixth of the network
hashrate, this means that the pool finds every 6th block, or every
hour.</p>
<p>This means that you can expect to early 31 cents every hour.</p>
<p>The question is, would you rather have a huge payout every couple
decades as a solo miner, or a small but regular payout mining in a
pool.</p>
<p>Obviously, pool mining sounds more attractive due to its low
variance.</p>
<p>And anyways, your ASICs will probably be really out of date in a
couple years, so you can’t realistically afford to have high variance in
your mining payout.</p>
<p>This leads to the paradox that: the more secure Bitcoin gets, with
more and more hash power, the greater the appeal is for joining a mining
pool, since your individual hash power decreases when more hash power
joins the network.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-miners">Types of Miners</h3>
<p><img src="/images/image213.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81088in" /></p>
<p>Of course, remember that there are various types of miners.</p>
<p>Some of these are known as “Reference Clients”–these control a wallet
to store private keys, a routing node to communicate with others, a
blockchain to validate transactions, and mining software to submit
hashing power to the network.</p>
<p>This is the code released by Bitcoin Core to miners.</p>
<p>Solo miners, on the other hand, have no wallet functionality,
probably have some other separate wallet software, and solely mine.</p>
<p>Aside from the wallet, they are identical to the Reference
Client.</p>
<p>Mining nodes are general nodes which have some mining hardware and a
protocol by which they connect to a mining pool.</p>
<p>There is the Stratum mining protocol, an unofficial standard for
submitting hashpower to a pool, but it’s not the only possibility.</p>
<p>These nodes, you’ll notice, have no burden of storing any
information.</p>
<p>They only need to store code and control hardware to interact with
the mining pools.</p>
<p>Supplement: Lightweight Mining</p>
<p>Author: David Luo</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Simple Payment Verification (SPV) is a method for verifying if
particular transactions are included in a block by only having to
download the block headers of each block, instead of the entire block,
which includes all of the transactions.</p>
<p>These SPV/lightweight clients are especially useful for clients who
have limited memory space and simply want bitcoin wallets without
downloading the entire blockchain.</p>
<p>There is also lightweight mining software, which differs from
lightweight wallet software. Instead of using SPV, users can mine using
other methods without downloading any data from the blockchain.</p>
<p>One way users with these lightweight clients are able to mine is by
joining a <strong>mining pool</strong>.</p>
<p>These miners work outside the network and only need to mine the
transactions the pool operator gives them, trusting that the operators
have the entire blockchain and the transactions given to them are
valid.</p>
<p>It is up to the pool operator to listen for new blocks and validate
the transactions.</p>
<p>To do this, the operator sends the miner a template of the block to
be working on.</p>
<p>If a block is found, it is bound to this template, which includes the
coinbase transaction that gives the reward to the pool operator.</p>
<p>This way, a user cannot steal the reward for themselves if they find
a block.</p>
<h3 id="getwork-getblocktemplate-and-stratum">getwork, getblocktemplate,
and Stratum</h3>
<p>getwork is a remote procedure call method that a client can call to
get a block header from a mining pool operator.</p>
<p>However, a caller of this method does not receive any information
about the block or the transactions within it.</p>
<p>A malicious server could easily send this user a block header hash
that contains invalid transactions, and the user would mine on this
invalid block.</p>
<p>getwork has been replaced by <strong>getblocktemplate</strong>, which
allows miners to create their own blocks instead of having to trust
somebody else (e.g. a pool operator) to provide them a valid block to
mine on.</p>
<p>Only a block template is provided with specific configuration
parameters, with block data that the client can modify if needed.</p>
<p>This way, the control is given back to the miner, because they can
now choose the transactions to be included in the block they are mining
on.</p>
<p>However, miners are incentivized to include pool specific data, such
as a coinbase transaction to the pool operator in order to make valid
shares and get rewards from the mining pool.</p>
<p>Although getblocktemplate does provide good functionality, it
requires a lot of bandwidth due to the transferring of the entire
block.</p>
<p>Because of this scalability issue, some pools now
use <strong>Stratum</strong>, which is another protocol for mining.</p>
<p>Similar to getblocktemplate, the server sends the client a block
template.</p>
<p>However, in Stratum only the block header and first transaction are
included, instead of the entire block.</p>
<h3 id="validationless-mining">Validationless Mining</h3>
<p>In order to mine, a client needs to have the block header hash of the
previous block, which comes from the block header of the previous block,
which in turn is generated from previous block.</p>
<p>One piece of information our new block needs to have is the block
header hash, as we must reference the previous block in the chain.</p>
<p>They can simply receive this value from an external source and mine
on that block.</p>
<p>This comes with one caveat, however, as the miner cannot validate the
block header hash and must place trust in whatever source such as a pool
operator they are getting the block header hash from.</p>
<h3 id="spy-mining">Spy Mining</h3>
<p>In mining pools, once a block is found, the block header hash is sent
imimagestely to the miners so they can all start mining on the new block
as soon as possible. Competing miners that are outside of this mining
pool can take advantage of this by <strong>connecting to the mining
pool</strong>, listen for the <strong>block header hash</strong>,
and <strong>mine on it for themselves</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="intro-bitcoin-governance">Intro: Bitcoin Governance</h3>
<p>We’ve discussed many of Bitcoin’s underlying mechanisms and
protocols, but we haven’t talked about how those changes came to be.</p>
<p>People want to change Bitcoin for a plethora of reasons.</p>
<p>For example, some may feel that it needs to be tied in more to the
original cypherpunk vision of decentralization, while others want higher
levels of security.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll be specifically talking about concerns of
mining centralization, proposed changes to Bitcoin’s mining puzzle, and
making consensus updates in Bitcoin.</p>
<h3 id="ensuring-decentralization">Ensuring Decentralization</h3>

<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image214.png" style="width:5in;height:2.84967in" /></p>
<p>Right now, one of the big features of Bitcoin, as well as other
cryptocurrencies is the fact they can theoretically be mined in a
decentralized manner.</p>
<p>There’s a reason we say “theoretically”, and it’s because mining is
tending towards becoming more centralized with the development of ASICs,
mining pools, and mining farms.</p>
<p>The fact that mining pools and mining farms is pretty straight
forward, as they’re usually run by a single entity.</p>
<p>ASICs on the other hand, are also centralized, but in the sense that
ASICs can cost a lot of money.</p>
<p>This means that only people with the enough capital can acquire them,
centralizing the mining process.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image215.png" style="width:5in;height:2.85436in" /></p>
<p>We’re going to attempt to address the problem of mining
centralization by considering the design of the underlying hash puzzle,
and see if there’s any way we can redesign it.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick reminder on what properties a cryptographic puzzle
should have.</p>
<p>A puzzle should be hard to solve but easy to verify.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, finding a nonce is incredibly difficult, but verifying
that a particular nonce is correct is much much easier.</p>
<p>The difficulty should be adjustable to account for changes in mining
technology (i.e. ASICs).</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, the difficulty is adjusted every two weeks.</p>
<p>You need a solving rate proportional to computational power, meaning
that the difficulty reflects the amount of hashpower in the network.</p>
<p>A puzzle should be “progress free”, meaning that finding a hash does
not make it easier to find the next hash.</p>
<p>Every solution is independent of the previous ones.</p>
<p>Lastly, you need a pseudo randomly generated puzzle.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s puzzle is described as a partial hash preimage puzzle.</p>
<p>You don’t have to find the exact preimage of the hash, as long as you
have the prerequisite number of leading zeros.</p>
<h3 id="ensuring-decentralization-asic-resistance">Ensuring
Decentralization: ASIC Resistance</h3>
<p><img src="/images/image216.png" style="width:5in;height:2.79355in" /></p>
<p>ASICs work because it’s easy to create hardware to compute just a
certain puzzle.</p>
<p>They’re computation bound.</p>
<p>A way to get around the problem of ASIC domination is to make puzzles
that rely not only on computation speed, but also on memory, giving rise
to the notions of memory-hard and memory-bound problems.</p>
<p>A memory hard problem is one that needs a large amount of requisite
memory to solve,</p>
<p>and a memory bound problem is a problem that scales based on the
amount of memory that you have.</p>
<p>These problems deter ASICs since optimizing computation is useless if
memory is the limit agent.</p>
<p>Dogecoin and Litecoin implement a memory-bound hash function called
Scrypt (pronounced ess-crypt).</p>
<p>They still use a partial hash-preimage puzzle like in Bitcoin, just
with a different hash function.</p>
<p>This means that ASICs that are built for Bitcoin don’t work for
Dogecoin or Litecoin.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image217.png" style="width:5in;height:2.67949in" /></p>
<p>Scrypt was originally designed to secure passwords and make them hard
to brute force, so a memory-bound type of problem makes sense.</p>
<p>Scrypt has two main steps: first fill a buffer with interdependent
data, and then access that data in a pseudorandom way.</p>
<p>To see why this is memory-bound, let’s take a look at what happens
when you fill a buffer with non-interdependent data.</p>
<p>Looking something up is easy, since you just find the index of the
datum you want.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image218.png" style="width:5in;height:2.71597in" /></p>
<p>However, if the data is interdependent on other pieces of data, you
have to look up those too.</p>
<p>If those aren’t stored in the buffer, then you have to spend time
computing them on the fly.</p>
<p>Depending on how much data there is, this can quickly become
infeasible, meaning that storing as much interdependent data in memory
is the only efficient option.</p>
<p>That’s what makes Scrypt memory-bound.</p>
<p>However, Scrypt also has its drawbacks.</p>
<p>It requires an equal amount of memory to verify, since verifiers have
to fill and access an equivalent buffer, with the same parameters.</p>
<p>Remember that puzzles should be easy to verify, so this is not
ideal.</p>
<p>In addition, even though Scrpyt was developed to be ASIC resistant,
an ASIC has actually been developed for it, so it’s no longer considered
ASIC resistant.</p>
<p>Another idea to achieve ASIC resistance that people tried was to
chain together a bunch of hash functions.</p>
<p>The idea was that it’s much harder to create an ASIC that can deal
with so many hash functions, not just once.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<h3
id="section-1"><img src="/images/image219.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81572in" /></h3>
<p>And that was the idea behind x11 and x13, which chain together 11 and
13 different hash functions together respectfully.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency Dash uses the x11 hashing algorithm, using a chain
of SHA3 variants.</p>
<p>Dash’s x11 was designed to be hard to make an ASIC for, but not
impossible, so it was never really intended to be ASIC resistant.</p>
<p>Developers wanted to get a good distribution of coin early in Dash’s
lifecycle,.</p>
<p>Later on, if someone happened to develop an ASIC for x11, coins would
have already been distributed in a fair way.</p>
<p>And that’s exactly what happened.</p>
<p>Another idea that was tossed around was to design coins that
periodically switched mining puzzles, making it difficult to
optimize.</p>
<p>For example, it could switch around from SHA-1 to SHA-3 to Scrypt for
6 months at a time each.</p>
<p>However, the overhead required to create such an algorithm has
historically deterred people from implementing it.</p>
<p>As a closing note, whenever there’s money that can be made, someone’s
going to be working to make the most profit.</p>
<p>In cryptocurrencies, that can take the form of working to create
ASICs for new hashing algorithms.</p>

&lt;img width=“40%” src=“/images/image221.png” alt=““&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p>As it turns out, ASIC resistance might actually not be that great of
an idea.</p>
<p>It’s still an ongoing debate.</p>
<p>In a non-ASIC-resistant system, ASICs tend to dominate the network,
suppressing regular people.</p>
<p>One common mantra in the early days of Bitcoin was “1 CPU 1 Vote”:
the idea was that mining was truly decentralized, with all nodes on the
network having an equal say in validating blocks.</p>
<p>The rise of ASICs has since diminished this, effectively giving some
people more votes than others.</p>
<p>ASIC-resistance brings back this idea of democracy, and decreases
mining centralization in the network.</p>
<p>A common counter-argument on the other hand, is that since ASICs are
designed solely to solve a cryptographic puzzle, they’re incapable of
anything else.</p>
<p>Miners who own ASICs are thus committed to the network.</p>
<p>Their hardware only has value in the network their ASICs were
designed for.</p>
<p>If a system with a large amount of miners relying in ASICs switches
to an ASIC-resistant algorithm and then the exchange rate of the
cryptocurrency crashes, many miners will suddenly be left with useless
electricity-gobbling hardware since they have no incentive to mine
anymore.</p>
<p>ASIC miners have already committed to the network by buying their
ASICs, so they do not want to do anything that would disrupt the
network.</p>
<p>Mining pools have historically disbanded once they’ve gotten too
large, since the news of a mining pool with a large amount of hashpower
would decrease trust in the network.</p>
<p>This idea of useless hardware and wasted hashpower leads us to our
next slide.</p>

&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image222.png” alt=““&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p>Since so much computational power is being expended to solve
cryptographic puzzles, which at their core are just pumping out random
numbers, why not make those puzzles something that can be useful to the
rest of the world?</p>
<p>For example, miners can search for large primes, look for aliens and
planets, simulate proteins at the atomic level, or generate predictive
climate models.</p>
<p>If we can use the whole computational power on the Bitcoin network to
work on these problems, we could solve them so much faster!</p>
<p>Wouldn’t being able to predict the weather be great?</p>
<p>It seems like a great idea, but there are issues.</p>
<p>These distributed computing problems are usually unsuitable for
proof-of-work and don’t work as cryptographic puzzles.</p>
<p>There’s a fixed amount of data in the system, meaning that there is a
finite number of solutions to the problem.</p>
<p>As soon as somebody has found the solution to a particular problem,
what happens then?</p>
<p>Or what if there’s not enough data to find a solution?</p>
<p>The problem can’t be used for proof-of-work anymore.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, since the puzzle is based on the previous block, the
problem space is inexhaustible.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image223.png” alt=““&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p>You can always generate more problems with more solutions.</p>
<p>In contrast, we used SETI@Home data for our puzzle, we could run out
of raw radio telescope data, leaving no problem to solve.</p>
<p>Next, potential solutions are not equally probable.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re looking for planets in the sky, one part of
the sky might be more populated than others.</p>
<p>It’s not equally likely that you’ll find a planet in all sections of
the sky.</p>
<p>In the hash functions of Bitcoin, it’s on average equally difficult
to find a solution.</p>
<p>Having a uniform solution space means that the only way to find a
solution is through pure brute force computation.</p>
<p>You can’t find any tricks or shortcuts that will let you avoid that
computation.</p>
<p>Lastly, these problems are delegated by central entities, as opposed
to to in Bitcoin, whose problems are created by its protocol.</p>
<p>It opens up the potential for collusion and exploitation.</p>
<p>When we rely on a central authority or central entity to create the
problem.</p>
<p>In summary, proof of useful work sounds like a great idea, but it’s
incredibly difficult to implement.</p>

<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image224.png” alt=““&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p>The idea behind a consensus update is that since Bitcoin is
decentralized, no one person can say “this is the change we’re going to
make in the protocol.”</p>
<p>Everybody has to agree, and come to consensus for an update to go
through.</p>
<p>There is a centralized team working on these protocol changes, the
Bitcoin Core team, along with a few other people that work on specific
parts of the software.</p>
<p>This is the software that’s used in full nodes.</p>
<h3 id="consensus-updates-forks">Consensus Updates: Forks</h3>
<h3
id="section-2"><img src="/images/image225.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81901in" /></h3>
<p>This brings us to the two ways that blockchains can be updated: hard
forks and soft forks.</p>
<p>Hard forks and soft forks refer not to forks as previously mentioned,
where two blocks are produced at the same time, but to protocol
forks.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that all miners operate independently, and it is not
mandatory for them to update their protocols.</p>
<p>When a large group adopts protocol changes, then the blockchain will
react in a couple different ways depending on the new protocol’s
rules.</p>
<p>A hard fork results from a new protocol that does things not allowed
in the old protocol.</p>
<p>An example is Bitcoin Cash, which increased the block size from 1MB
to 8MB.</p>
<p>The nodes on the old, legacy Bitcoin protocol are going to refuse the
new 8MB blocks, leading to a permanent fork as seen in the diagram.</p>
<p>These two forks would then theoretically continue forever as long as
both chains have support, miners who continuously run that software.</p>
<p>Essentially, the hard fork is not backwards compatible.</p>
<p>In a soft fork, the rules of the new protocol are only
restrained.</p>
<p>For example, if a new Bitcoin fork called Bitcoin Dollars were to
reduce the block size to half a megabyte, then everything valid in the
new protocol is still valid in the old protocol.</p>
<p>However, the old protocol’s blocks are no longer valid in the new
protocol, meaning that a soft fork is backwards compatible but not
forwards compatible.</p>
<p>As seen in the bottom picture, the new and old nodes will accept
blocks from the new protocols, but the old nodes will never have their
blocks accepted into the longest chain mined by the new nodes.</p>
<p>The new nodes then pressure the old nodes to adapt the new protocol,
so that they’re not left behind.</p>
<p>Before every fork, hard or soft, the entire community launches into
debates about the future of Bitcoin.</p>

</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, changes to the protocol come in the form of BIPs, or
Bitcoin Improvement Proposals.</p>
<p>These can be changes in the network protocol, block or transaction
validation, or anything affecting interoperability.</p>
<p>This is the way the community votes on changes that they want to
support.</p>
<p>There are three types of BIPS: standard, informational, and
process.</p>
<p>A standard BIP is an actual update or change to the protocol.</p>
<p>This is how the ecosystem changes, and what miners vote on.</p>
<p>Informational BIPs are more so guidelines on how people should do
things in the future, but it doesn’t change the protocol.</p>
<p>An example of an informational BIP would be a BIP talking about how
to run a mining pool.</p>
<p>The last BIP, process BIPs, are specific things that should be done
as well as best practices.</p>
<p>The first BIP was by Amit Taaki in 2011, and was actually a BIP to
make BIPs.</p>
<p>Miners vote on BIPs by including a reference to that BIP in the block
that they mine.</p>

<h3 id="ii.-wallets">II. Wallets</h3>
<p>The primary function of Bitcoin wallets is to keep track of your
identity. In Bitcoin, a private key gives you a claim to your virtual
identity; it unlocks your virtual identity and gives you access to your
Bitcoin address. Wallets primarily store your private keys, but most
wallet softwares also generate public/private keys with each new
transaction and track your transactions. Unlike the physical wallets we
use for money, Bitcoin wallets do not store physical bitcoins. They’re
simply impossible to store. Hence, control over private keys is
essentially control over identity and bitcoins.</p>
<p>There are two types of Bitcoin wallets: hot wallets (Mycelium,
AirBitz, Webapp, Mobile App, etc) are connected at some point to the
internet, while cold wallets (i.e. paper and hardware) are not. </p>
<p>You can find them at Bitcoin ATMs, where you can trade cash for
bitcoins. You can also get bitcoins through an exchange, where you can
trade between different types of fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies.
Centralized exchanges are easy to use and access, but are single points
of failure which may be vulnerable to hacks. Decentralized exchanges
(i.e. Bitshares and Bitsquare) conduct trades directly between users by
creating proxy tokens and are mostly trustless but may suffer from
liquidity problems. </p>
<h3 id="iii.-wallet-mechanics">III. Wallet Mechanics</h3>
<p>For wallets to successfully keep track of your identity and bitcoin,
they must implement mechanisms to verify transactions and keep track of
many keys. </p>
<p>When using a wallet software, you do not have to download the full
Bitcoin blockchain thanks to Simple Payment Verification (SPV). SPV is a
method for verifying if particular transactions (specifically your own
transactions) are included in a block without having to download entire
blocks. Instead, you can simply ask your neighbors for relevant info
about the blocks, though you must trust they will give you legitimate
data. </p>
<p>To maintain anonymity, it is best practice never to reuse pseudonyms.
Bitcoin addresses are cheap to generate, and using a new pseudonym for
each transaction makes tracking your activity and discovering your
identity much more difficult. </p>
<p>The traditional way to keep track of a large number of keys is
through a “Just a Bunch of Keys” (JBOK) wallet: a new key pair is
created and backed up for every transaction. However, JBOKs are hard to
scale. You can see how exchanges have to deal with thousands of
transactions a day for thousands of users would need something more
efficient than JBOK wallets. </p>
<p>Hierarchically Deterministic (HD) Wallets overcome this problem by
deriving all new keys from an original random seed value. In HD Wallets,
anyone controlling the parent key can also generate and control child
keys.</p>
<h3 id="iv.-mining">IV. Mining</h3>
<p>Mining in Bitcoin requires miners to verify incoming transactions,
create a block, find a valid nonce, broadcast the block, and earn a
profit in bitcoins.</p>
<p>Miners are primarily motivated to maintain the network, or execute
the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism and bring new bitcoin into
circulation, by earning profit. Miners only earn a profit from mining
when the revenues from the block reward and the transaction fees are
greater than the fixed and variable costs of mining.</p>
<p>A block reward is a reward that goes to miners whose blocks are
included in the longest chain. Bitcoin incentivizes honest mining by
rewarding miners in bitcoin. The block reward halves every 210,000
blocks, approximately 2 years, and will fall to 0 once 21 million
bitcoins have been mined.</p>
<p>Regardless of the number of bitcoins in circulation, miners will
always be rewarded via transaction fees.</p>
<p>The main fixed cost in mining is the hardware that allows users to
mine. CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs are all types of hardware that have
been used for mining, and each is more computationally powerful than the
last. ASICs, which stands for Application-Specific Integrated Circuits,
are currently capable of computing 14 trillion hashes per second. They
are fully specialized devices that can only do one activity: mine for
Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The main variable costs associated with mining are energy and
infrastructure costs (i.e. warehouse and personnel). Energy costs are
further divided into three types: Embodied Energy, to produce hardware;
Electricity, to power hardware; and Cooling, to maintain hardware.</p>

<p>Even with the most impressive technology, it still takes a great
amount of time and power to find a block. Mining pools allow miners to
join their hash power together so that they will collectively find
blocks and collect rewards more often, reducing variance. As a member of
a mining pool, your reward is calculated by the number of “shares” you
contribute. A share is defined as a near valid block, used to estimate
the mining power you contributed. More shares equals more attempts at
finding a valid nonce equals a larger slice of the pie.</p>
<p>The two main payment mechanisms in mining pools are:</p>
<p>Pay-per-Share: where miners are paid a fixed amount of money for each
share, regardless of how much reward the pool makes</p>
<p>Proportional Schemes, where miners receive a reward proportional to
the number of shares submitted before the block was found</p>
<p>Pay-per-Share pools are advantageous to the miner because of
guaranteed payouts, but risky for the pool because miners have no
incentive to submit valid blocks to the pool. Proportional Schemes are
advantageous for the pool because the pool operator only pays out after
a block is found, but more risky for the miner due to greater variance
of reward.</p>
<h3 id="vi.-changing-bitcoin">VI. Changing Bitcoin</h3>
<p>One of the current challenges of Bitcoin is that mining is tending
towards centralization with the development of ASICs, mining pools, and
mining farms. ASICs cost a lot of money, which means only those with
access to high volumes of capital can afford them, thereby concentrating
the mining power into the hands of a few. To address this issue, we must
develop a tweak to the protocol that reduces centralization but still
adheres by the puzzle requirements (quick to verify, adjustable
difficulty, and computationally difficult).</p>
<p>We can get around the ASIC domination by creating a memory-hard or
memory-bound puzzle, periodically switching mining puzzles, or replacing
Proof of Work by Proof of Useful Work.</p>
<p>While ASIC resistance may decentralize mining and make it a more
democratic process, achieving ASIC resistance may also cause disruptions
to the mining community that would undermine the network. </p>
<p>Real changes are implemented in Bitcoin via hard or soft forks. Hard
forks result from a new protocol that does things not allowed in the old
protocol. In a soft fork, the rules of the protocol are only restrained.
A soft fork is backwards compatible but not forwards compatible.</p>

<p>In Bitcoin, changes to the protocol come in the form of BIPs, or
Bitcoin Improvement Proposals. These can be changes in the network
protocol, block or transaction validation, or anything affecting
interoperability. There are three main kinds of BIPS: standard,
informational, process.</p>

<h3 id="module-5-how-to-destroy-bitcoin-game-theory-attacks">Module 5:
How to Destroy Bitcoin: Game Theory &amp; Attacks</h3>
<p>With all our knowledge so far, we have a pretty good understanding of
Bitcoin high level motivations and design, as well as low level
mechanics.</p>
<p>So now with our knowledge of the ins and outs of Bitcoin… let’s
destroy it :)</p>
<p>Looking from a game theoretical perspective, we’ll formulate attacks
and other malicious behavior that can potentially destroy Bitcoin.</p>
<p>One note is that although we have been focusing primarily on Bitcoin
so far, now we’re starting to build an understanding of not just
Bitcoin, but cryptocurrencies and blockchain in general.</p>
<p>This module is called “How to Destroy Bitcoin: Game Theory and
Attacks” but you can understand that the game theoretical approach and
analysis of attack vectors applies to all proof-of-work blockchains –
not just Bitcoin.</p>
<h3 id="intro-pool-strategies">Intro: Pool Strategies</h3>
<p>As we explained in the previous module, everything is driven by
profit – and Bitcoin is certainly no exception.</p>
<p>For example, it might not be profitable to be a solo miner,
especially if you don’t have a lot of specialized hardware.</p>
<p>You might want to join a mining pool, where users pool together their
computing resources so that collectively they all have an increased
likelihood of finding the next block, and thus receive the block
reward.</p>
<p>As we’ll see in this section, there are some strategies you can
employ to increase your profits even further.</p>
<p>And when it comes to making the most profit, honest strategies are
NOT usually the best way to go.</p>
<h3 id="pool-reward-scheme-review">Pool Reward Scheme Review</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- Pool Reward Schemes: Reviews ------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image231.png” alt=“Pool Reward Schemes:
Reviews”&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p>Remember from last lecture that pay-per-share schemes will pay you a
fixed amount of money for each share, or near-valid block.</p>
<p>This payment is guaranteed and constant per share, regardless of how
much reward the pool makes.</p>
<p>One issue is that there’s no incentive for a miner to actually submit
valid blocks to the pool because the amount of revenue collected from
that share is equal to any other share.</p>
<p>Miners will stop doing work on their current block as soon as it
satisfies the near-valid block requirements.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- Pool Reward Schemes: Proportional ------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image232.png” alt=“Pool Reward Schemes:
Proportional”&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p>Proportional schemes are the other category which pay out only when a
block is found.</p>
<p>The reward of each miner is proportional to the number of shares
submitted before the block was found.</p>
<p>However, this scheme is disadvantageous for the miner because the
miner now has to bear the risk of not finding a block, and therefore the
variance of rewards.</p>
<p>They only get paid when a valid block is found by the pool.</p>
<p>For the same reason, proportional pay-out schemes are beneficial to
the pool, since they only have to pay miners when a valid block is
found.</p>
<p>Given the incentive structures in both pay per share and proportional
pool pay-out schemes, is it possible that pools are vulnerable to some
incentive misalignment?</p>
<h3 id="pool-hopping">Pool Hopping</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- Pool Rewards: Pool Hopping Strategy ------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image233.png” alt=“Pool Rewards: Pool
Hopping”&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p>Remember that we as miners want to maximize their payout.</p>
<p>Well, is there a way that we can take advantage of proportional
payout schemes?</p>
<p>This graph is a general representation of the difference between
pay-per-share payouts and proportional payouts.</p>
<p>We know there must be some intersection between these two because the
proportional payout starts off high but decreases while the
pay-per-share scheme stays constant.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- Pool Rewards: Pool Hopping Strategy ------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image234.png” alt=“Pool Rewards: Pool
Hopping”&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p>This graph might reveal something to you right away.</p>
<p>If not, don’t worry – you’re about to see how we can increase our
profit margins though a little bit of cleverness.</p>
<p>Here, you see the area under the curve, which represents the total
reward per share times the number of shares.</p>
<p>If we mine under just the proportional scheme, the reward gained per
share decreases as more and more shares get submitted towards this
block, meaning that our marginal rewards start to approach zero.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- Pool Rewards: Pool Hopping Strategy ------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image235.png” alt=“Pool Rewards: Pool
Hopping”&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p>In this example, we see the same type of graph but for
pay-per-share.</p>
<p>It’s a giant rectangle, extended a small amount by every share that
we mine.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous scheme, this one doesn’t approach zero.</p>
<p>Instead, the value of each share stays constant.</p>
<p>A clever miner will look for ways to take advantage of both payout
schemes to increase that total area under the curve, to increase their
total profit from shares.</p>
<p>And here’s how they can do that.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- Pool Rewards: Pool Hopping Strategy ------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image236.png” alt=“Pool Rewards: Pool
Hopping”&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p>Let’s say a miner starts off mining under the proportional payout
scheme.</p>
<p>This means that each share is very valuable in the beginning.</p>
<p>If we start mining here and find a block quickly, then we make a
large amount of profit per share.</p>
<p>However, if we don’t find a block for quite a while in this pool, our
shares start to become less profitable.</p>
<p>To get maximum profit, we can reconsider where we put our mining
power.</p>
<p>Instead of continuing to mine in the proportional scheme, we switch
to the pay-per-share scheme.</p>
<p>Right at the intersection point.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the reward per additional share there is higher, and will
yield more profit, than the proportional payout.</p>
<p>To fully understand this attack, you need to see the point at which
the two curves intersect.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- Pool Rewards: Pool Hopping Strategy ------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image237.png” alt=“Pool Rewards: Pool
Hopping”&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p>And this is when the value per share of the proportional scheme
decreases beneath the value per share of the pay-per-share scheme.</p>
<p>This is why the attack is known as pool hopping: the miner hops to
the most valuable pool as they see fit.</p>
<p>A generalization is to say that a miner will rationally mine in the
pool providing the most reward per share.</p>
<p>Because of this, honest and loyal miners will be cheated out of
profit by the rational miners, who choose personal profit over the
group.</p>
<p>Because of this, proportional pools are not feasible in practice.</p>
<p>Thus far, designing a mining pool reward scheme that both aligns
incentives fully and is not vulnerable to pool hopping remains an open
problem.</p>
<p>A pool with fully aligned incentives would both have miners aim to
submit nonces that produce valid block headers to the pool and stay
loyal to the pool.</p>
<p>The proportional scheme incentivizes miners to submit such nonces,
but it doesn’t incentivize miner loyalty.</p>
<p>Pay-per-share pools are the inverse, as previously mentioned.</p>
<p>We’ll see how this misalignment of incentives in pay-per-share models
can lead to even further attacks.</p>
<h3 id="pool-cannibalization">Pool Cannibalization</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------- Pool Cannibalization: Strategy --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image238.png” alt=“Pool
Cannibalization: Strategy”&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p>Remember, in a pay-per-share model, a miner is not incentivized to
give their mining pool any valid blocks.</p>
<p>There’s no extra reward to the individual for finding a share that
gives the pool a block.</p>
<p>Is there a way that we can exploit this incentive misalignment?</p>
<p>Turns out there is!</p>
<p>You might have started to predict the attack by now.</p>
<p>If we get paid out for finding near-valid shares, why not just get
paid for work without submitting valid blocks? And this is known as pool
cannibalization.</p>
<p>You may recognize the person in this image on the right side of the
slide.</p>
<p>This is Hannibal Lecter, fictitious cannibal, from the TV Show
“Hannibal.”</p>
<p>Just like Hannibal is a person that consumes other people, pools can
“consume” parts of other pools through pool cannibalization.</p>
<p>The way we “consume” other pools is that if we have a decent amount
of mining power, we can distribute some of our power into other
pay-per-share schemes, but for these pools, we don’t submit valid
blocks.</p>
<p>This way, we can be paid by those other pools without increasing
their revenue.</p>
<p>With pool cannibalization, we increase own personal profit at the
detriment of other pools.</p>
<p>The advantage of this attack is that it’s very hard to detect in
small amounts.</p>
<p>Let’s go ahead and show why this is the case through some
calculations.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------- Pool Cannibalization: Strategy --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image239.png” alt=“Pool
Cannibalization: Strategy”&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p>Let’s first establish some assumptions.</p>
<p>Let’s say we have 30 hashes per second of power in your pool, and the
total network has 100 hashes per second.</p>
<p>Easily, we see that we have 30 percent of the network hashrate.</p>
<p>On top of that, there’s a current block reward of 1 bitcoin per
block.</p>
<p>These numbers are for simplicity’s sake to set up the stage for the
pool cannibalization analysis and not at all representative of real
world conditions.</p>
<p>With basic statistics, we can calculate an expectation of profit per
block.</p>
<p>This is the average profit made per block, which is not to be
confused with the actual profit per block.</p>
<p>If we have thirty percent of the network hashrate, this means we are
also expected to get thirty percent of the blocks in the longest
chain.</p>
<p>By implication, we are also expecting to earn thirty percent of the
total mining rewards on average, which is 0.3 bitcoins per block.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve established this scenario, let’s consider something:
we buy a bit more hardware, currently worth 1 percent of the total
network hashrate.</p>
<p>Let’s consider what we can do with this extra mining power.</p>
<p>The standard, simple thing to do with this extra mining power is add
it to your own resources.</p>
<p>This means we have 31 hashes per second, and the total network has
101 hashes per second.</p>
<p>We now have 30.69 percent of the total hashrate.</p>
<p>This means that our increase in profit is 0.0069 bitcoins from our
extra hardware.</p>
<p>But how can we leverage our previous knowledge about pay-per-share
pools?</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------------- Pool Cannibalization: Example ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image240.png” alt=“Pool
Cannibalization: Example”&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p>Well, by doing something mean but profitable: distributing our 1 unit
of mining power among all the other pools – the other 70% of the network
hash power.</p>
<p>However, we make sure to that we do not add to their revenue.</p>
<p>We withhold any valid blocks while submitting all other shares.</p>
<p>The result is that the pools pay out to us – because we’re still
submitting shares – but does not gain any benefit from our hash power –
since we don’t submit valid blocks.</p>
<p>What that looks like in this particular scenario is as this: the rest
of the pools are 70 parts honest, 1 part dishonest.</p>
<p>By honest, we mean mining and submitting valid blocks.</p>
<p>Dishonest is disobeying this intent and withholding valid blocks, and
that’s what we’re doing.</p>
<p>What this means is that the effective hashrate of the other pools has
not changed: it’s still 70%.</p>
<p>However, the mining pools are still paying out to us.</p>
<p>This means that our expected value of mining with this one percent of
hashpower ends up being 0.0098 bitcoins.</p>
<p>You’ll notice a scary conclusion.</p>

</p>
<p>Dishonesty is more profitable than honesty!</p>
<p>We’ve just shown that it’s more profitable to cannibalize pools than
to mine directly through our own pool.</p>
<p>This is a scary deduction that we’ve made, but it doesn’t stop
here.</p>
<p>If it’s more profitable for any pool to do this, then what does that
look like across the network?</p>
<p>Will pools all start cannibalizing each other?</p>
<p>Is everyone going to start being dishonest for profit?</p>
<p>Are pools going to wage war on each other through this attack?</p>

<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image242.png” alt=“Pool Wars: The Game
of Life”&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p>Like all other competitions for resources, we can model this problem
as a game and analyze it with economic game theory.</p>
<p>We have several players all attempting to maximize their individual
profit, and they each have choices about whether to cannibalize.</p>
<p>We can, for the sake of analysis, view it as an iterative game.</p>
<p>In other words, there are distinct rounds, and a choice needs to be
made each round.</p>
<p>There are several different mining pools in the Bitcoin network, but
let’s focus on two theoretical pools: Pool 1, and Pool 2.</p>
<p>Each round, or iteration, is a case of the Prisoner’s Dilemma.</p>
<p>The Prisoner’s Dilemma refers to a problem of cooperation.</p>
<p>Pool 1 and Pool 2 both want to attack each other to increase their
own personal profit at the expense of the other.</p>
<p>However, if they both attack each other, they’ll be worse off than if
they both chose to cooperate and not attack at all.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------------- Pool Wars: Nash Equilibrium ----------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center" width="100%">
&lt;img width=“50%” src=“/images/image243.png” alt=“Pool Wars: Nash
Equilibrium”&lt;/&gt;
</p>
<p>Let’s say Pool 1 chooses to attack Pool 2.</p>
<p>Pool 1 increases its own personal profit, as demonstrated in the last
section, but Pool 2 suffers.</p>
<p>So what’s to stop Pool 2 from retaliating to increase revenue?</p>
<p>Well, nothing!</p>
<p>Pool 2 has no reason not to attack Pool 1 back.</p>
<p>Because of this, choosing to attack is tempting for both pools.</p>
<p>In fact, we can formally say that both pools attacking each other is
a Nash Equilibrium.</p>
<p>A Nash Equilibrium, put simply, refers to the choices that actors see
as most profitable, as long as the others’ decisions remain
unchanged.</p>
<p>Both Pool 1 and Pool 2 would not stop attacking, even if the other
stopped attacking, because that would imply less profit for
themselves.</p>
<p>However, if both Pool 1 and Pool 2 attack each other, they both lose
mining power relative to the rest of the network.</p>
<p>This means that their profit from attacking is actually less than if
they both chose not to attack each other.</p>
<p>Why don’t they just not attack each other and make more profit than
in this Nash Equilibrium?</p>

</p>
<!---
<img src="/images/image244.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8in" />
---->
<p>Well, the no-pool-attacks scenario is not a Nash Equilibrium.</p>
<p>In other words, if both pools choose not to attack each other,
they’re not making as much profit as they could be.</p>
<p>There’s a more profitable option out there for them.</p>
<p>By attacking, they can increase their profit, and that’s what we’ve
established all actors want to do.</p>
<p>Because of this, you fall into this issue where rational actors will
eventually choose the Nash Equilibrium if they’re pursuing profit.</p>
<p>So, they’ll continually attack each other in hopes of making
profit.</p>
<p>Sure, if pools adhere to a culture where they agree not to attack
each other through cannibalization, then everyone benefits in the long
run.</p>
<p>However, it’s not a guarantee that all pools will adhere to this:
anonymously or not, nothing is stopping them at this point other than
social constructs.</p>
<p>Except for the fear of getting attacked, there’s a large amount of
incentive to attack other pools for profit.</p>
<p>Pools might be able to detect these attacks in the future, and
detection of these attacks would allow for a long term solution, but as
of now it’s still very difficult to detect.</p>
<p>We can’t always tell the origin of mining power, meaning that we
either trust that we’re not being attacked or accept that there’s no
solution to this problem.</p>
<p>Because of this, you can see the problem as a Tragedy of the Commons,
in which all pools are individually incentivized to act in ways that do
not as a whole improve the wellbeing of the entire group.</p>
<p>It all comes back to this issue of aligning personal incentives with
group incentives.</p>
<h3 id="supplement-game-theory">Supplement Game Theory</h3>
<p>Author: Rea Savla</p>
<p>We can model the behavior of different actors in the Bitcoin network
for a given situation using a game theoretical analysis. Our first
assumption is that actors will act in a rational way, where rationality
is defined as taking the actions that maximize their utility. In our
scenario, utility is defined by the monetary gains resulting from an
action. While not everyone in Bitcoin is purely motivated by monetary
gain, this is still a powerful generalization.</p>
<p>A <strong><em>Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium </em></strong>is the set
of actions that maximize each actor’s utility given the responses of all
the other actors. Note, the utility each player receives depends on the
player’s own decisions and the decisions of all the other actors, in the
same way that the rewards a miner gets in the mining pool depend on the
miner’s own decision to attack or cooperate and the rest of the pool’s
decision to attack or cooperate. Players in the Bitcoin network or in a
mining pool will converge to acting according to the Pure Strategy Nash
Equilibrium for a given scenario, assuming they all behave
rationally.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a simple scenario. Suppose there are only 2
mining pools in the Bitcoin network, Pool A and Pool B. Their utilities
are shown below. The numerical value of utility is arbitrary in
economics; it does not have any associated units, and it is calculated
using a utility function of other parameters, defined by the economist.
We are only interested in the comparative value of an action’s utility,
whether it is higher or lower than another; we are not interested in its
absolute value. In this example, the respective utilities are derived
from the monetary gains each player would receive from the given
scenarios of attacking or cooperating with the other.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image245.png" style="width:5in;height:2.08in" alt="A table representing Pool A and Pool B demonstrating the relationship between their utilies" /></p>
<p>The specific numerical values for the utilities in this example were
chosen arbitrarily to reflect a scenario where players are incentivized
to act dishonestly, but fare worse when both players are dishonest than
when both players are honest. Let’s take the perspective of Player A.
Given Player B acts honestly, player A gains the most utility from
acting dishonestly, since a utility of 3 is greater than the utility of
2 that A would receive by acting honestly.</p>

<p>Given Player B acts dishonestly, Player A would prefer also acting
dishonestly since a utility of 1 &gt;utility of 0.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image247.png" style="width:5in;height:2.09192in" /></p>
<p>Player B makes the same conclusions, and makes preferences as
follows:</p>

<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image248.png" style="width:5in;height:2.15447in" alt="Player B&#39;s dishonesty utilities are highlighted as well as Player A&#39;s. " /></p>
<p>We can see that the scenario in which both players choose to act
dishonestly is the Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium, since at this
position, both players are maximizing their payoffs given the other
player’s actions. Thus, despite receiving higher returns from both
acting honestly, Players A and B will both act dishonestly.</p>

<h3 id="intro-double-spending">Intro: Double Spending</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve discussed some pool game theory, let’s go ahead and
revisit the classic attack of the cryptocurrency world: the double spend
attack.</p>
<p>We previously discussed this at a high level in the first lecture,
mentioning that we use computational resources to prevent double-spend
attacks.</p>
<p>But how does this actually look within the blockchain?</p>
<p>On top of that, is there still a way to double spend?</p>
<p>Can I double spend with less than a majority of the voting power?</p>
<p>We’ll answer all those questions for you in this upcoming module.</p>
<h3 id="race-attack">Race Attack</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image249.png" style="width:5in;height:2.85528in" /></p>
<p>Let’s revisit the definition of a Double Spend attack.</p>
<p>It means being able to successfully spend the same value more than
once.</p>
<p>Keep this in mind as we go through the attacks in the following
slides.</p>
<p>Imagine this scenario: in the year 2099, I’m an old lady, and I want
to buy the new iPhone 92XCS from Rustie on the black market.</p>
<p>I’m offering a whopping 100 bitcoins, but I doesn’t actually want to
give up my money.</p>
<p>So how can I double spend on Rustie?</p>
<p>Well, it all depends on how early Rustie’s willing to give me the
iPhone.</p>
<p>We’ll explain what that means right away.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image250.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8275in" /></p>
<p>Suppose Rustie is very naive and trusting.</p>
<p>The moment he sees a valid transaction from me, he sends me the
iPhone.</p>
<p>This is before the transaction even enters a block – he makes the
assumption that if the transaction is floating around the network, it
will eventually make its way into a block and he’ll get paid.</p>
<p>I can take advantage of that.</p>
<p>I can trick him by sending him a valid transaction and sending the
rest of the network a conflicting transaction.</p>
<p>While Rustie has the impression that I am sending the UTXO to his own
address, I tell the rest of the network that I want to send that same
UTXO to a different address, which is actually another address that I
control.</p>
<p>I can incentivize miners to choose the second transaction by making
the transaction fee for that higher as well.</p>
<p>It’s possible, then, that Rustie sends me the iPhone but I get to
keep my money.</p>
<p>I just successfully double spent on Rustie through a race attack.</p>
<p>It’s called a race attack because the timing of transactions affects
the outcome.</p>
<p>The transaction to Rustie doesn’t go through because it’s beat by the
second transaction that spends from the same UTXO.</p>
<p>The second transaction making its way into the blockchain prevents
poor Rustie from ever getting his bitcoins.</p>
<p>Defense: Confirmations</p>
<p>So how might Rustie protect himself from this?</p>
<p>Well, we know that Rustie only gets to keep his bitcoins if a
transaction to him makes its way into the longest chain.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image251.png" style="width:5in;height:2.82946in" /></p>
<p>And, as we know, the longest chain could be forked early on.</p>
<p>To provide some confidence in the immutability of the transaction, he
can look for what we call confirmations.</p>
<p>Instead of just accepting a transaction as valid when he sees it
floating around the network or when it first makes its way into a block,
Rustie waits for the transaction to get a certain number of
confirmations.</p>
<p>A confirmation is defined as the number of blocks built off of some
particular block.</p>
<p>In this diagram, there’s the block holding my transaction to Rustie,
and there’s two blocks built on top of that.</p>
<p>This means that there’s two confirmations on this block.</p>
<p>The more confirmations a transaction has, the harder it is to double
spend, since a malicious miner such as myself would have to fork the
chain starting from before the block that contains that transaction, and
mine fast enough to surpass with the honest chain.</p>
<p>This is a reasonably simple concept, but we can see some interesting
things that involve confirmations.</p>
<p>The question you’re probably asking: how many confirmations does
Rustie need before he feels confident about the finality of his
transaction?</p>
<p><img src="/images/image252.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8125in" /></p>
<p>Well, let’s go back to the example with me and Rustie.</p>
<p>Rustie’s gotten wiser from the last time I double spent on him, so
he’s now going to wait for some confirmations before sending the
iPhone.</p>
<p>Let’s say he waits for “k” confirmations.</p>
<p>This means he waits for k blocks to be built on top of his
transaction before deeming the transaction finalized.</p>
<p>From my perspective, I now needs to find a way for Rustie’s
transaction to get k confirmations,</p>
<p>but I then need to find a way to produce a longer chain containing
the transaction spending from the exact same UXTO back to myself.</p>
<p>This longer chain will invalidate Rustie’s transaction.</p>
<p>The way I do this is by starting a private chain containing my own
malicious transaction, mine k blocks, and then broadcast the chain after
Rustie has sent the iPhone to me.</p>
<p>By doing so, I will have received the goods and have kept my own
bitcoin.</p>
<p>A quick note: in this demonstration, I will mine k + 1 blocks on top
of the block that contains my own transaction to myself.</p>
<p>If I mined just k blocks, I would have caught up with the rest of the
network.</p>
<p>But if I want to invalidate the honest chain with the transaction
from me to Rustie, my chain has to be longer.</p>
<p>Hence, the plus one.</p>
<p>Let’s go ahead and see a demonstration.</p>
<h3 id="demo-confirmations">Demo: Confirmations</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image253.png" style="width:5in;height:2.85526in" /></p>
<p>Let’s say that k in this case is equal to 2 confirmations.</p>
<p>In other words, Rustie will assume that the transaction is finalized
after 2 confirmations.</p>
<p>I publish my transaction to Rustie, and it has been included within a
block.</p>
<p>One confirmation….</p>
<p>Two confirmations.</p>
<p><img src="/images/image254.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8318in" /></p>
<p>Rustie notices the two confirmations and feels confident about the
transaction’s finality.</p>
<p>He now sends me the iPhone so as not to keep me waiting.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image255.png" style="width:5in;height:2.86939in" /></p>
<p>But that was exactly what I was expecting.</p>
<p>This whole time, I was mining on a private chain which I did not
reveal to the rest of the network.</p>
<p>This chain contains a transaction from the same UTXO, to a different
address which I also control.</p>
<p>This transaction from me to myself is to make sure that the
transaction from me to Rustie is forever invalid and can never be
republished.</p>
<p>This is because once the network accepts the transaction from me to
myself, the corresponding</p>
<p>UTXO is used up, and since both this transaction as well as the
transaction from me to Rustie spend from the same UTXO, this then
invalidates the transaction from me to Rustie.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image256.png" style="width:5in;height:2.9765in" /></p>
<p>When I broadcast my chain, the rest of the network accepts my chain
over the previous chain because it’s longer.</p>
<p>Because of this, the entire chain of blocks, containing the
transaction from me to Rustie, and onward is invalidated.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image257.png" style="width:5in;height:2.84238in" /></p>
<p>The rest of the network will continue mining on my chain, meaning
that I will have received Rustie’s iPhone while still keeping my own
money.</p>
<p>Hooray!</p>
<p>I have successfully double spent!</p>
<p>However, notice that my double spending of Rustie relied on my
ability to produce a longer chain than the honest network.</p>
<p>You might be wondering: what is the probability of me being able to
produce a chain longer than the rest of the network?</p>
<p>Well, we’ll see right away how that’s possible.</p>
<h3 id="probability-analysis">Probability Analysis</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image258.png" style="width:5in;height:2.83226in" /></p>
<p>These graphs show the probability of a successful fork.</p>
<p>The top shows the probability of an attacker catching up to some
chain given two parameters:</p>
<p>the amount of mining power possessed by the attacker, and the amount
of blocks by which the honest chain is ahead.</p>
<p>The bottom graph is a mirrored image, as it shows the probability
that a transaction is safe after some k number of confirmations.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the top graph first.</p>
<p>The blue line represents the probability of an attacker with 10
percent of the network hashrate successfully producing a chain of equal
length to the honest network.</p>
<p>Even just catching up to one block is only a 20 percent chance, and
it tapers towards zero quickly.</p>
<p>The curves generally look like an inverse exponential curve, in that
the probability starts off high but then quickly drops towards zero.</p>
<p>The exception is mainly with the 50 percent model.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image259.png" style="width:5in;height:2.83679in" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the 50 percent model has a probability of 1 no matter
what.</p>
<p>In other words, an attacker with 50 percent of the network hashrate
has a 100 percent chance of creating a chain of equal length to the
honest chain.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of fancy statistics to get to these exact values, but
we’ll save that for readings.</p>
<p>To quickly comment on the second graph, you’ll notice that it’s a
flipped over version of the top graph.</p>
<p>This is because there’s only two possibilities that we’re considering
with any transaction: its chain is the longest chain, or it’s
invalidated by a longer chain.</p>
<p>Because of this, the probability of one event is 1 minus the
probability of the other.</p>
<p>In addition, this leads us to the following conclusion: if the
attacker has 50% of the network hashrate, then we have a 0 percent
probability that our transaction is ever safe.</p>
<p>At any time, the 50% attacker can produce a chain that will catch up
with the rest of the honest network.</p>
<p>With more than 50%, say 51%, I will always be able to double
spend.</p>
<p>I will always be in full control of which blocks are included within
the history of transactions.</p>
<h3 id="goldfinger-attack">Goldfinger Attack</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image260.png" style="width:5in;height:2.80206in" /></p>
<p>But here’s a question to ask: just because I can double spend doesn’t
mean I should.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of real world consequences of double spending that we
don’t consider when just discussing theory and math.</p>
<p>If the rest of the world ever realizes that a double spend attack was
conducted on Bitcoin, the value would plummet instantaneously because
there’s no longer any belief in the finality of transactions and the
security of the network.</p>
<p>My own bitcoin would drop in value as well, and that means I’ll lose
a lot of money.</p>
<p>In addition, all the specialized hardware I own would be useless as
well, since the hardware can only mine Bitcoin.</p>
<p>If Bitcoin is worthless, then so is the hardware.</p>
<p>What are some other options?</p>
<p>Well, I can bribe miners.</p>
<p>If I don’t own the hardware or don’t want to spend that much capital
on hardware that’s about to become useless with a successful attack,
might as well bribe other miners to mine on my own withheld chain.</p>
<p>But what if I’m a hostile government, adversarial altcoin, large
institution, or other enemy to the network with a large amount of
capital?</p>
<p>Well, then there’s a way for me to make up my money even after buying
all that hardware.</p>
<p>What I can do is called a “Goldfinger” attack, named after the James
Bond movie of the same name.</p>
<p>The point of this attack is to profit off the destruction of some
assets.</p>
<p>In the James Bond movie, the villain tried to profit off the
destruction of gold in Ft. Knox.</p>
<p>With Bitcoin, I can short the currency, meaning to place a bet on its
devaluation.</p>
<p>I can first place a bet that Bitcoin is going to go down in value,
then I can launch the double spend attack to make my prediction go
through.</p>
<p>At this point, double spending on someone is – interestingly enough –
just a means to an end.</p>
<h3 id="intro-censorship-attacks">Intro: Censorship Attacks</h3>
<p>Thus far, we’ve looked at examples of how users with enough hashpower
can take advantage of the properties of the blockchain in order to
maliciously double spend their coins.</p>
<p>Now, we’ll look at another sort of attack: the censorship of
transactions.</p>
<p>With censorship, we can choose to ignore the transactions from an
individual or group of individuals, isolating them from the network and
effectively rendering their bitcoins useless.</p>
<h3 id="censorship-attacks-naive-censorship">Censorship Attacks: Naive
Censorship</h3>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image261.png" style="width:5in;height:2.82384in" /></p>
<p>Let’s say that Gloria is in charge of the Glorian nation, and has
jurisdiction over all of the mining pools within its boundaries, which
sums up to be over 51% of the Bitcoin network’s hash power . Gloria
doesn’t like me, so her goal is to censor all of my Bitcoin addresses
and prevent me from spending any of my Bitcoin.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image262.png" style="width:5in;height:2.85528in" /></p>
<p>The blocks in Gloria’s ideal blockchain will include none of my
transactions.</p>
<p>The most naive strategy is for Gloria to instruct all of her mining
pools not to include my transactions, also known as blacklisting.</p>
<p>However, unless Gloria’s mining pools have 100% of the entire
networks hashpower, other miners outside of her jurisdiction will
eventually include my transactions in a block.</p>
<p>This doesn’t fully blacklist me, and only ends up causing delays and
inconveniences, although those delays and inconveniences can become
significant depending on how much hashpower</p>
<p>Gloria has.</p>
<h3 id="censorship-attacks-punitive-forking">Censorship Attacks:
Punitive Forking</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image263.png" style="width:5in;height:2.82018in" /></p>
<p>Let’s look at another strategy for Gloria.</p>
<p>Remember that Gloria’s mining pools have over 51% of the network
hashrate.</p>
<p>She can say that all Glorian pools will refuse to work on a chain
containing transactions spending from my address and announce this to
the world.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image264.png" style="width:5in;height:2.80206in" /></p>
<p>If miners include one of my transactions in a block, Gloria will fork
and create a longer proof-of-work chain, which is possible only because
she has the majority of the hashrate.</p>
<p>The blocks containing my transactions are now invalid since they
aren’t on the longest chain and will never be published.</p>
<p>This also means that the miners on that chain will receive no mining
rewards for their efforts.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image265.png" style="width:5in;height:2.85901in" /></p>
<p>Non-Glorian miners will eventually stop including my transactions in
their blocks since they know that their blocks won’t be part of the
longest chain anway.</p>
<p>They’ll be invalidated by Glorian miners.</p>
<p>This strategy is known as punitive forking, and can be very powerful
in the hands of someone with a 51% majority hashrate.</p>
<p>That entity can prevent anybody from accessing their funds.</p>
<p>Censorship Attacks: Feather Forking</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image266.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8125in" /></p>
<p>However, punitive forking doesn’t work unless Gloria has 51% of the
hashpower, which is extremely difficult to achieve in reality. Is there
another way? Unfortunately for me,</p>
<p>Yeah…</p>
<p>There is a strategy called feather forking, in which Gloria announces
that she will attempt to fork if she sees a block with one of my
transactions. But she will give up after a while.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to punitive forking, since that only works if a
longer chain is guaranteed by the fork. In short, Gloria gives up after
a block with my transactions has k confirmations, where k is any number.
In the diagram, Gloria sees a block containing one of my transactions
and attempts to fork. However, I get 3 confirmations, so she gives up
trying to continue her fork.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image267.png" style="width:5in;height:2.80724in" /></p>
<p>Let’s look at a little bit of math. Let q be the proportion of mining
power that Gloria has. Let k equal one, so that Gloria gives up after
one confirmation on my block. This means that the chance of successfully
orphaning my block is q squared, since Gloria has to compete with each
confirmation. If q is 20%, then gloria has a 4% chance to orphan my
block, which isn’t that great.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image268.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81572in" /></p>
<p>However, other miners are now aware that their block has a q^2, or 4%
chance of being orphaned.</p>
<p>They now have to decide whether they should include my transaction in
their block. The expected value of including my transaction is the
chance that my block is included times the block reward, plus the
transaction fee that I pay. The expected value of not including my
transaction is simply just the block reward, since all miners would be
working on that chain.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image269.png" style="width:5in;height:2.82776in" /></p>
<p>Therefore, looking at the math, unless I pay at least q^2 times the
block reward in transaction fees, other miners will mine on the
malicious chain. As of April 17th 2018, that would be a $4000 minimum tx
fee, which is incredibly limiting. It’s very likely that I won’t be able
to afford those transaction costs, so I won’t be even be able to send my
transactions through. Thus, Gloria has succeeded in censoring my
transactions with only 20% of the total hashrate.</p>
<p>Intro: Selfish Mining</p>
<p>It’s important to consider how rational and malicious actors will
behave to increase the amount of money that they make.</p>
<p>Think back to the previous module, specifically the motivations for
mining.</p>
<p>If there’s a way for miners to maximize profit, assume that they will
do so, even if it’s not totally fair to everyone else.</p>
<p>One of the best examples of this sort of behavior is selfish
mining.</p>
<h3 id="selfish-mining-attacks">Selfish Mining Attacks</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image270.png" style="width:5in;height:2.77349in" /></p>
<p>Let’s say that you’re a miner, and you just found a block.</p>
<p>You want to give yourself an advantage over the rest of the network,
so instead of publishing the block through the network and receiving the
block reward, you keep your block a secret.</p>
<p>Since you haven’t released your block, you’re effectively the only
person working on the most recent block, and you effectively have 100%
of the hashpower on your hidden chain.</p>
<p>Nobody else on the network can even attempt to solve the hash
puzzle.</p>
<p>This is called selfish mining, or block withholding.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image271.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8113in" /></p>
<p>Note that Block withholding is sometimes also used in the context of
mining pools, where you submit shares but withhold blocks.</p>
<p>If you find two blocks on your secret chain before the network finds
the next one, you suddenly have the longest chain.</p>
<p>The network believes it’s mining on the longest chain, but little
does it know that you actually have the longest chain.</p>
<p>You essentially fooled the network.</p>
<p>You’ve guaranteed yourself at least two block rewards because you can
just continue to mine on your own chain, assuming that you always stay
ahead of the honest network’s chain.</p>
<p>The moment the honest network is about to catch up to you, you can
just publish your hidden chain, and then suddenly the honest chain is
invalidated, since your chain is the longest, and as we already know,
honest nodes in the network will always choose the longest chain.</p>
<p>So, you can continue mining this way and continue cheating the system
until the honest network catches up to you.</p>
<p>You’ve guaranteed yourself more block reward than the honest network,
and most importantly, you deny the honest network the chance to do any
meaningful work because you have your own secret chain, and you can
imimagestely invalidate the honest chain as soon as you publish your
secret chain.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image272.png" style="width:5in;height:2.83226in" /></p>
<p>Assuming you’re two blocks ahead of the honest network, if the honest
network then finds a block, you broadcast your two secret blocks to
claim your two block rewards and to keep the honest network from
catching up.</p>
<p>This makes the honest network’s block invalid, since the honest chain
is now the shorter one.</p>
<p>Because the honest network was mining on chain that was then
invalidated, you effectively got time to mine by yourself, for free.</p>
<p>Since you had no competition, you had a higher proportion of the
effective hashrate, and therefore, a higher expected return.</p>
<p>The key thing to note here is that you assume that you as a malicious
miner can find two blocks faster than the rest of the network can find
one block.</p>
<p>If you can’t, then your computation is the one that goes to
waste.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image273.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81617in" /></p>
<p>What if the network finds a block before you find a second one?</p>
<p>Then it becomes a race to propagate the new blocks.</p>
<p>As it turns out, if you have the capability of telling 50% of the
network about your block before the other party, as well as greater than
25% of the hashpower, then a malicious strategy is more profitable.</p>
<p>If you have greater than 33% of the hashpower, you can lose the
propagation race every time and the malicious strategy will still be
more profitable!</p>
<p>The math behind these results is omitted here due to complexity, but
you’re more than encouraged to look into it!</p>
<h3 id="intro-defenses">Intro: Defenses</h3>
<p>As malicious miners are incentivized by higher potential profits to
attack or try to subvert the network, honest individuals are
incentivized to prevent such behavior.</p>
<p>There’s a constant struggle to try to patch up the Bitcoin ecosystem
to prevent anything that would completely destroy Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In this next section we’ll be taking a look at some of the defenses
we have to counter selfish mining.</p>
<p>We’ll first take a look at some of the more naive defenses, and see
what we can improve from there.</p>
<h3 id="block-validation">Block Validation</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image274.png" style="width:5in;height:2.83398in" /></p>
<p>One of the earlier proposed solutions to solving selfish mining was
to validate blocks using dummy blocks that hold metadata.</p>
<p>This technique was proposed by Schultz in 2015, and later by Solat
and Potop-Butucaru in 2016.</p>
<p>The idea is that in addition to having regular blocks, we also create
additional (dummy) blocks that contain signatures for that block.</p>
<p>So, for any given block, it is easy to look at the corresponding
dummy block to verify how many users have seen and signed off on that
block.</p>
<p>Blocks that are selfishly mined would only have been seen by the one
withholding the blocks, and would not have sufficient signatures.</p>
<p>This proves that an honest block is witnessed by the network, and
also proves that a competing block is absent before miners are able to
work on it.</p>
<p>When a malicious actor that has been withholding blocks finally
publishes their chain, all but the first block will be automatically
rejected, since the first block would not have sufficient
signatures.</p>
<p>With this method, selfish miners can’t make more than their expected
reward, which is just for one block.</p>
<p>This invalidates a lot of the work they do to build the chain off of
the first block they find.</p>
<p>Therefore, block validation with this dummy block signature scheme
disincentivizes selfish mining.</p>
<p>One imimageste flaw that we can see is that this technique is
vulnerable to Sybil attacks.</p>
<p>There’s no way to guarantee that the signatures on a block all come
from different users.</p>
<p>And so the selfish miner could just generate as many fake signatures
as needed to make it seem like the withheld blocks are valid.</p>
<p>They can do this because as we know from before, it’s easy to
generate new identities in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And furthermore, there’s no real way of determining how many
signatures is enough to show that a block is valid.</p>
<p>For example…</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image275.png" style="width:5in;height:2.82665in" /></p>
<p>What order of magnitude is the threshold number of signatures?</p>
<p>And would it have to change depending on the changing number of users
within the network?</p>
<p>These questions are all hard to answer but are important to this
schemes implementation</p>
<p>Also, no matter how many signatures are needed, a malicious user
could still easily Sybil attack the system.</p>
<p>So in the end the fact that there’s no good way of determining a
signature volume threshold and the fact that it’s susceptible to a Sybil
attack makes the entire defense useless.</p>
<p>Furthermore, another downside to having dummy signature blocks is
that their implementation would require fundamental changes to the
already established block validity rules.</p>
<p>Such a change would require a hard fork, which is undesirable.</p>
<h3 id="fork-publishment">Fork Publishment</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image276.png" style="width:5in;height:2.80769in" /></p>
<p>Another idea for a defense against selfish mining was
fork-punishment, which was proposed by Lear Bahack in 2013.</p>
<p>The fork-punishment rule is as it sounds: it punishes anyone who
forks the blockchain.</p>
<p>Any competing blocks receive no block reward, regardless of whether
they were mined selfishly or honestly, and the first miner who proves
that there was indeed a fork gets half of the forfeited rewards from the
previous block height.</p>
<p>This disincentivizes malicious users to attempt to fork the
blockchain by working on their own secret chain, and also incentivizes
honest miners to report any forks that they have seen.</p>
<p>In the diagram below, we see that there’s a fork, the top being the
honest chain and the bottom being the dishonest chain.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image277.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8141in" /></p>
<p>Since two blocks are broadcast at the same block height, they are
competing blocks and thus neither of them have an associated block
reward.</p>
<p>The first miner who proves that there was a fork, and includes this
in the next block, gets the block reward for the block they just mined,
as well as half of the block reward from the previous block height.</p>
<p>One of the imimageste drawbacks is that because we punish all
competing blocks, honest miners suffer collateral damage from
fork-punishment.</p>
<p>And the fact that we’re punishing honest miners constitutes a
different kind of attack Fork-punishment also suffers from the fact that
we would have to fundamentally change Bitcoin’s reward distribution
rules.</p>
<p>We’d have to have some way of changing the coinbase transactions of
blocks where there was a fork.</p>
<p>To do this and also to forward half of the block reward to the next
block, we’d have to leverage a concept called transaction malleability,
which is out of scope for this course.</p>
<p>And in the end, fork punishment would require a hard fork to
implement, and as before, that’s pretty undesirable.</p>
<h3 id="uniform-tie-breaking">Uniform Tie-Breaking</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image278.png" style="width:5in;height:2.79948in" /></p>
<p>Instead of punishing everyone whenever there’s a fork, like in fork
punishment, is there another way?</p>
<p>Perhaps we can instead prevent the block propagation race, and
consider each submitted block at each block height.</p>
<p>For this, we can use uniform tie-breaking, which was an idea proposed
by Eyal and Sirer in 2014.</p>
<p>When we have a race to propagate, the miner who has a network
advantage is more likely to get their block accepted into the longest
chain.</p>
<p>This is because they are better connected in the Bitcoin network and
are able to get their block out to more people.</p>
<p>We can use uniform tie-breaking to protect against selfish miners who
have a network advantage.</p>
<p>After each block is published, instead of taking the first seen block
as valid, since this might be a block from a well-connected selfish
miner, each miner first waits to hear about all competing blocks.</p>
<p>In the case of a tie, where a miner sees multiple blocks at the same
block height, the miner randomly chooses which chain to mine on.</p>
<p>By randomly choosing which chain to mine on, miners mitigate an
attacker’s network-level dominance.</p>
<p>Eyal and Sirer found that the default Bitcoin protocol has a profit
threshold of 0% if there exist selfish miners that are really well
connected in the network and can thus influence the way data flows
through the network.</p>
<p>This would then mean that for Bitcoin to be entirely secure, 100% of
the network has to be honest.</p>
<p>In their paper, with their proposed uniform tie-breaking, they
claimed that it raised the profit threshold for selfish mining to
25%.</p>
<p>However, later in 2015, a separate paper published by Sapirshtein
proposed a more optimal selfish mining strategy that reduced the profit
threshold down to 23.2%.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image279.png" style="width:5in;height:2.80566in" /></p>
<p>A 25% profit threshold using uniform tie-breaking is pretty bad,
considering that selfish mining is always profitable when you have 33%
of the mining power.</p>
<p>Even more shocking is when we compare this to our original design for
Bitcoin, which was supposed to be tolerant of up to 50% malicious
miners.</p>
<p>How do we improve 25%?</p>
<p>In 2014, Ethan Heilman proposed a defense of selfish mining using
timestamps.</p>
<p>The idea is that timestamps would be issued by a trusted party and
incorporated into every block by miners.</p>
<p>Timestamps would be global across the entire Bitcoin network, and
would be issued regularly, say every 60 seconds.</p>
<p>They also would be publically accessible, but unforgeable because
we’d use cryptographic signatures.</p>
<p>Blocks are considered in competition if they are received roughly
within the same timeframe, say 120 seconds of each other, and when the
situations arises when there is competition between blocks, then miners
simply will pick the block whose timestamp is fresher, or the most
recent.</p>
<p>In the paper, it says that the profit threshold for selfish miners
using this method of unforeable timestamps goes up to 32%, a solid
improvement from the 25% we saw with uniform tie-breaking.</p>
<p>As it turns out, selfish miners can easily break this defense.</p>
<p>Tie-breaking rules only apply when there’s a block propagation race,
NOT when the selfish mining chain is longer than the public chain.</p>
<p>And as it turns out, it has been shown that if an attacker has a
large amount of computational power, say greater than 40%, then these
tie-breaking defenses against selfish mining are essentially
worthless.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image280.png" style="width:5in;height:2.83959in" /></p>
<p>As you can see in the diagram on the bottom, a selfish miner can
still invalidate the honest chain if they have the longest chain.</p>
<p>Miners will pick the longest chain, since it has the most work done
on it, and will weight this more than the fact that a block in the
honest chain is “fresher”, or more recent.</p>
<p>And another thing you might have realized is that this defense
requires a trusted third party to distribute timestamps to everyone.</p>
<p>The drawback here is that Bitcoin aims to be as decentralized as
possible, and while this might work with other systems, centralization
certainly doesn’t mix with Bitcoin’s philosophy.</p>

<p><img src="/images/image284.png" style="width:5in;height:2.80645in" /></p>
<p>Now we get into one of the more recent developments in selfish mining
defenses.</p>
<p>This one is called Publish or Perish, and was published by Zhang and
Prenell in 2017.</p>
<p>Previous defenses we’ve seen had many flaws, such as requiring a hard
fork – for example in fork punishment – or not disincentivizing selfish
mining when the selfish miner has a longer chain – for example in
unforgeable timestamps.</p>
<p>Publish or perish claims to be the best – yet defense of selfish
mining, and addresses all these previous issues.</p>
<p>It doesn’t require a hard fork, which means that it’s backwards
compatible with the old chain, and it also disincentivized selfish
mining even when the selfish miner has a longer chain.</p>
<p>The idea of selfish mining boils down to maliciously building a
secret block, and the publishing that off into a chain.</p>
<p>Publish or perish’s main goal was to make sure that secret blocks do
not help selfish miners at all.</p>
<p>To do this, Publish or perish’s approach focuses on amending
Bitcoin’s Fork Resolving Policy, or FRP.</p>
<p>By default, we know that miners choose the longest chain to be valid,
so for Bitcoin, we say that it has a length FRP. Publish or perish’s
insight was to switch from length to weight as a heuristic for the fork
resolving policy.</p>
<p>Instead of just counting the length of chains, we also consider
weight, which is roughly making it disadvantageous to withhold
blocks.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of terminology and formal definitions, so we’ll be
going into that first.</p>
<p>We define Tau as assumed upper bound on the time it takes to
propagate blocks across the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>And from a miner’s perspective, the term in time means that for a
valid receiving block, either (1) it height value is greater than that
of the local head, or (2) its height value is the same as that of the
local head, but was propagated within tau time.</p>
<p>The bottom diagrams illustrate the two possible requirements for a
block to be in time.</p>
<p>On the left side, a block is received withing tau time, so that block
is in competition with the current head.</p>
<p>On the right side, the block received has a height value that’s one
greater than the local head, so we just append it to the blockchain.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- Publish or Perish: Zang and Preneel ------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image285.png”Publish or Perish: Zang and
Preneel” style=“width:5in;height:2.8in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>The term uncle refers to an in-time block that competes with a block
parent – the parent being the previous block to the current.</p>
<p>To formalize, the uncle of a block B is one less the height of B.
Makes sense because the uncle of B has to be at the same height as B’s
parent.</p>
<p>And for the uncle of B to be in time, it must be within tau time of
B’s parent.</p>
<p>The diagram on the right side nicely summarized the definition of an
uncle block.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!--------------------- Publish or Perish: Weighted Fork Resolving Policy ------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image286.png”Publish or Perish: Weighted Fork
Resolving Policy” style=“width:5in;height:2.8in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>We have our child block B, and previous to that, we have its parent
A. At the same block height to A, we have blocks C and D. Block C is an
uncle to B because it is within tau time of B’s parent, A. Block D on
the other hand is not an uncle to B because while it has the correct
height – one less the height of B – it was not seen in tau time of B’s
parent, A. So it’s not an uncle.</p>
<p>The weight of a chain – from a miner’s perspective – is the number of
its in time blocks plus the number of in time uncle blocks. And to make
sure we have valid in time blocks and in time uncles, we make miners
embed Hashes of the blocks that count toward blocks weight.</p>
<p>That way, others can easily verify the blocks weight.</p>
<p>And again, we say everything from a miner’s perspective because
whether a block in time is evaluated from the miner’s local
perspective.</p>
<p>And we calculate the weight of a chain starting from the block after
its root, since competing chains always have a shared root.</p>
<p>For example, in the diagram on the right hand side, all three of
these chains are rooted block R.</p>
<p>Having defined weight, you can kinda see how miners are
disincentivized from withholding blocks.</p>
<p>If you withhold blocks, then your blocks won’t be in time, and so
they’ll have less weight.</p>
<p>With all these definitions, we can now specify the weighted fork
resolving policy.</p>
<p>It has three main rules.</p>
<p>If one chain is longer height-wise than the other(s) by k or greater
blocks, then miners will mine on this chain.</p>
<p>If a chain is longer than the others by k blocks, we can probably
trust it to be a valid chain.</p>
<p>This kind of inherits the notion of an honest majority from the
default Bitcoin length FRP. If a chain is longer than other chains by k
blocks and its malicious, then we have a bigger problem on our hands;
everything’s broken so we should just stop using Bitcoin since someone
probably owns a majority of a network hash power.</p>
<p>If all chains are within k blocks height of each other, then the
miner will choose to mine on the chain with the largest weight.</p>
<p>If the largest weight is achieved by multiple chains simultaneously,
the the miner chooses one among them randomly.</p>
<p>One note is that in the first rule k is a failsafe parameter that
gauges the allowed amount of network partition.</p>
<p>If we set k to infinite, then the rule never applies.</p>
<p>So now that we’ve spent all this time defining all these terms and
procedures, let’s look at how publish or perish actually disincentivizes
selfish mining.</p>
<p>Here’s the general scenario.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------ Publish or Perish: Selfish Miners ------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image287.png”Publish or Perish: Selfish Miners”
style=“width:5in;height:2.8in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>Say that a selfish miner has already secretly mined one block. Before
they can mine a second block, the honest network publishes a competing
block. There’s now a block propagation race. At his point in time, the
selfish miner has two options: option 1, to publish, or option 2, not to
publish.</p>
<p>If the selfish miner publishes their block, the next honest block
would gain a higher weight because it could embed a proof of having seen
its uncle.</p>
<p>On the other hand, publishing a block would ensure that it would
contribute to the weight of the selfish chain, since it’s in time. So,
the selfish miner’s block gets a weight of 1, but also contributes to
the weight of the honest chain.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the selfish miner keeps their block secret and
misses the time window for being in time, then the secret block would
not contribute to the weight of its own chain. So, the selfish miner’s
block gets a weight of 0, but since the honest network wouldn’t have
seen this secret block either, it wouldn’t contribute to the weight of
the honest chain.</p>
<p>The key takeway is that no matter which option the selfish miner
chooses in the end, neither option gives weight to the selfish chain
that is not also given to the honest chain.</p>
<h3 id="publish-or-perish-analysis">Publish or Perish: Analysis</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------------- Publish or Perish: Analysis ----------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image288.png”Publish or Perish: Analysis”
style=“width:5in;height:2.8in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>For a bit more clarity, let’s take a more rigorous approach to our
analysis of the previous scenario.</p>
<p>In the diagram on the bottom, the dark circles represent blocks that
are found by the selfish miner, and the dark triangles represent blocks
are found by honest miners.</p>
<p>The circle and triangle outlines represent a count in the weight of
the selfish and honest chains, respectively, and as always, blocks are
mined from left to right.</p>
<p>So imagine at this point in time, as before, the selfish miner has
one block, let’s call it S, and the honest network just published a
competitor to S.</p>
<p>In option 1, the selfish miner chooses to publish S. Since S is
published within tau time of the honest competitor, it counts into the
weight of the selfish chain.</p>
<p>However, since S then becomes an uncle to the next honest block, it
also counts into the weight of the honest chain.</p>
<p>So, S counts into the weight of both the honest and selfish
chains.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the point in time where we the have diagram below,
both the honest and selfish chains have a weight of 3 despite the fact
that there are only two honest blocks but three selfishly mined
blocks</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!--------------------------------- Publish or Perish: Option 2 ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image289.png”Publish or Perish: Option 2”
style=“width:5in;height:2.8in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>In option 2, the selfish miner doesn’t publish S, and instead chooses
to wait, and publish later on as part of the selfish chain.</p>
<p>Since S is published late – as in not within tau time – it would not
contribute to the weight of the selfish chain.</p>
<p>And also it wouldn’t an uncle of the next honest block, so S doesn’t
contribute to the weight of the honest chain either.</p>
<p>In option 2, S contributes to neither the weight of the honest nor
the selfish chain.</p>
<p>If we have scenario depicted in the diagram below, both the honest
and selfish chains have a weight of 2, despite there being three
selfishly minedblocks and only two honestly mined blocks.</p>
<p>The result is that regardless of which option the selfish miner
chooses, S will NOT contribute to only the weight of the selfish
chain.</p>
<p>It will only contribute to both or neither.</p>
<p>This completely nullifies the advantage of having S in the first
place.</p>
<p>Here are a couple graphs on the expected revenue of selfish miners
when publish or perish is in effect.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------------- Publish or Perish: Graphs ----------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image290.png”Publish or Perish: Graphs”
style=“width:5in;height:2.8in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>On the left side, we have a graph of selfish miners’ profit, given
that certain defenses are in place.</p>
<p>Particularly notable is the performance of publish or perish in
comparison to optimal tie breaking.</p>
<p>Optimal tie breaking is the theoretical optimal defense that always
rejects selfish blocks whenever there’s a tie, with 100% accuracy.</p>
<p>Notice that publish or perish even outperforms this theoretical
optimal tie breaking defense.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------------- Publish or Perish: Limitations -------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image291.png”Publish or Perish: Limitations”
style=“width:5in;height:2.8in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>On the right side, we have revenue given different values of k, which
again is the threshold number of blocks ahead a chain has to be in order
for miners to just automatically choose to mine on that one.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the higher the value of k, the less revenue selfish
miners will make.</p>
<p>Revenue is the lowest when we set k to infinity, at which point
miners will always look to mine on the chain with the most weight.</p>
<p>One important note is that there’s still a big gap between the ideal
expected profits, which is linear in the amount of mining power one has,
and even the lowest revenue publish or perish scheme at k =
infinity.</p>
<p>So as good as publish or perish says it is, it still doesn’t reach
Bitcoin’s intended goal of having hash power being directly proportional
to mining reward.</p>
<p>As it stands, selfish mining is still an effective way to gain more
profit, given that you have a significant amount of hash power, but with
publish or perish it’s more difficult to pull off.</p>
<p>Publish or perish actually has a lot of limitations too.</p>
<p>First off, it assumes synchrony, and Bitcoin is asynchronous.</p>
<p>It’s not useful to define an upper bound on block propagation time
because you can never be sure if all the blocks at a certain block
height have been delivered or not.</p>
<p>This is something inherent in large distributed systems like Bitcoin,
and we’ll be exploring this in detail in our second course.</p>
<p>For example, for any fail-safe parameter k &gt; 1, an attacker could
broadcast their blocks right before they are late.</p>
<p>This would cause inconsistent views among honest miners, since some
would see the blocks as in time, and some would see them as late,
depending on how long it took these blocks to propagate across the
network.</p>
<p>It’s not just publish or perish though.</p>
<p>For all defenses or upgrades or proposals that assume Bitcoin is
synchronous, everything just falls apart, because you can’t
realistically make these assumptions about the network, especially since
Bitcoin is publish and open to anyone.</p>
<p>Also, since publish or perish would be rolled out as a software
update to bitcoin miners, not all miners would update their software at
the same time.</p>
<p>During the transition period from Bitcoin’s default length FRP to the
weighted FRP, attackers could potentially leverage the situation and
launch double-spend attacks on confused users.</p>
<p>Another limitation of publish or perish is that it neglects some real
world factors.</p>
<p>Due to network latency, there are often naturally occurring forks,
but there are not permitted in this model.</p>
<p>It doesn’t consider transaction fees as an additional incentive on
top of block rewards.</p>
<p>And it also doesn’t consider when there are multiple selfish miners,
and how they would interact with each other and with the rest of the
network.</p>
<p>In the end, publish or perish doesn’t achieve true incentive
compatibility.</p>
<p>However, analyzing publish or perish and all the other works we’ve
looked through is a very good start in designing better defenses for
Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Maybe porting over publish or perish into an asynchronous model is a
good direction for how we can approach defending against selfish
miners.</p>
<h3 id="the-bitcoin-network">The Bitcoin Network</h3>
<p>Taking a step back from analyzing individual defenses, it’s important
to understand the actual Bitcoin network itself.</p>
<p>After all, as we saw with publish or perish, which sounded really
awesome in theory, it ultimately fails to work in practice due to
assumptions about certain properties about the Bitcoin network –
particularly that of synchrony.</p>
<p>So first off, the Bitcoin network is peer to peer, and there’s no
central entity sending and receiving messages for us.</p>
<p>The way that messages get sent around the network is through a gossip
protocol, which also called flooding.</p>
<p>If i wanted to send out a transaction I have to tell all the nodes
I’m connected to, which we call my neighbors.</p>
<p>All my neighbors tell their neighbors, and their neighbors tell their
neighbors, and so on.</p>
<p>For example, if the network actually looked like this…</p>

<!-------------------------------- Bitcoin Network: A Closer Look -------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image292.png”Bitcoin Network: A Closer LOok”
style=“width:5in;height:2.8in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>…and I wanted to send a message to Nick……I would tell my neighbors
Derrick and Gloria.</p>
<p>Derrick and Gloria would then tell their neighbors, and thankfully
Derrick is connected to Nick, so Nick gets my message.</p>
<p>Also, one note is that as we discussed in the Bitcoin mechanics
module, my message would be digitally signed.</p>
<p>The way you get connected and join the Bitcoin network in the first
place is by a recursive procedure.</p>
<p>Hardcoded into the Bitcoin core software is a list of seed peers that
you connect to initially.</p>
<p>You ask these seed nodes for their neighbors, pick some, ask these
nodes for their neighbors, and repeat this until you think you have a
fairly random set of connections.</p>
<p>Bitcoin allows each node to have a maximum of 125 connections, and
generally you have 8 outbound connections and 117 inbound
connections.</p>
<p>To further understand how information propagates through the Bitcoin
network, we have to understand the network topology and latency.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- Bitcoin Network: An Uneven Topology ------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image293.png”Bitcoin Network: An Uneven
Topology” style=“width:5in;height:2.8in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>Network topology means how the Bitcoin network looks like if you were
to graph it out like we’ve been doing with circles – for individual
nodes – and lines – for connections between nodes.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, we want an even topology.</p>
<p>We want each node to have roughly the same weight, mining power in
our case, have random connections, and look fairly uniform.</p>
<p>But this isn’t really the case.</p>
<p>As we know, there’s a huge difference in mining power node to
node.</p>
<p>This means that some nodes are more influential than others.</p>
<p>Is the Bitcoin network truly as decentralized and distributed as we
thought?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Let’s say Derrick has an incredibly high hash rate…</p>
It could be that he’s running a mining farm or pool.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- Bitcoin Network: Uneven Influences ------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image294.png”Bitcoin Network: Uneven Influences”
style=“width:5in;height:2.8in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>We can’t really tell, since mining farms and pools sometimes want to
remain secret so people don’t attack them.</p>
<p>Derrick is arguably more influential than other nodes in the
network.</p>
<p>Compare his hash power with someone who’s just an SPV node hanging
out in the network, or a node that’s just a solo miner.</p>
<p>Derrick’s pool a lot more hash power than any of these.</p>
<p>And there’s no easy way of determining the network topology.</p>
<p>If Derrick is running a mining pool, his miners don’t have to be
directly connected on the Bitcoin network at all.</p>
<p>They could just be connecting to Derrick’s node directly through some
lightweight protocol.</p>
<p>So all of Derrick’s miners form a secret subgraph essentially.</p>
<p>And it turns out that due to this hidden graph topology, and the fact
that Derrick could be multiple nodes on the network, possibly running
multiple pools, Derrick could potentially hide the fact that he has more
than 50% of the network hash power.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image295.png”Bitcoin Network: An Uneven Topology
(3)” style=“width:5in;height:2.8in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>And scarier yet, Derrick doesn’t even need 50% of the network hash
power.</p>
<p>As we saw with the attacks and defenses previously, Bitcoin suffers
from some incentive alignment problems, especially in the case of
selfish mining.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the Bitcoin network could be in jeopardy if
Derrick’s pool – or pools – had 33% of the network hash rate.</p>
<p>Or 25%… or 23.2%….or 32%….</p>
<p>Perhaps there’s an attack or selfish mining scheme that hasn’t been
discovered yet that lowers the profit threshold even lower.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image296.png”Bitcoin Network: Different
Propogation Times” style=“width:5in;height:2.8in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>In addition to network topology, we also have to worry about the
network latency.</p>
<p>As we saw in publish or perish, a selfish miner could publish his
secret blocks right before it’s too late.</p>
<p>Some nodes would see it as in time, and others would see it as
late.</p>
<p>And that’s a pretty good example for how network latency is an issue
here.</p>
<p>Also, consider the case where two miners find a valid block at the
same time.</p>
<p>There’s a race to propagate like before, and the miner who is better
connected in the network and has a faster propagation time would
ultimately win.</p>
<p>This leads to disproportionate profits in miners.</p>
<p>Miners who are better connected in the network see things faster and
are able to send out messages and blocks faster too.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it’s possible that a poorly connected miner could spend
all this time finding a block, and when it finally finds one, its
propagation time could be so slow due to network latency that within
that time, another miner would have already found and submitted a
competing block to a majority of the network.</p>

<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image297.png”Bitcoin Network: Sybil Attack
Revisited” style=“width:5in;height:2.8in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>And now for something even bigger.</p>
<p>Think back to the first module, where we discussed Sybil attacks and
how it’s not beneficial to have more identities because in
Proof-of-Work, we make computational power the limiting factor.</p>
<p>Well, if we’re clever enough, we can launch a Sybil attack in another
kind of way, leveraging what we just went over: network topology and
latency.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------- Bitcoin Network: Flood the Network ----------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image298.png”Bitcoin Network: Flood the Network”
style=“width:5in;height:2.8in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>Let’s say Derrick has the ability to flood the network with
nodes.</p>
<p>These could either be his miners, or if he’s clever enough, he could
even write malware that make victims’ computers act like 0-power nodes –
just sitting there listening to the Bitcoin network, and relaying
information back to Derrick.</p>
<p>They’d act like sensors.</p>
<p>Derrick could sybil attack honest miners by leveraging his network
level dominance.</p>
<p>Let’s say Derrick is also selfish mining, and already has some secret
blocks, which are distributed to all of his 0-power nodes.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- Bitcoin Network: Flood the Network (2)---------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image299.png”Bitcoin Network: Flood the Network
(2)” style=“width:5in;height:2.8in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>When Derricks nodes hear about the next honest block X, Derrick could
ignore X, and publish his secret block P.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- Bitcoin Network: Flood the Network (3) --------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image300.png”Bitcoin Network: Flood the Network
(3)” style=“width:5in;height:2.8in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>If block P reaches a miner before block X, then the miner by default
mines on block P.</p>
<p>In this attack, Derrick leverages both the network latency and
topology.</p>
<p>Derrick is well connected and has less latency, and is able to
propagate his secret block P faster than if he only had control of one
node.</p>
<p>He also has unique ownership of the network topology, since he owns a
lot of nodes around the network, and also since he has a large
proportion of the network mining power.</p>
<p>As a closing note, know that outside of what we presented in this
module, there are a lot more attacks and defenses, such as eclipse
attacks and stubborn mining, which take into account network latency,
topology, and more.</p>

<h3 id="i.-pool-strategies">I. Pool Strategies</h3>
<h3 id="i.i-pool-hopping">I.I Pool Hopping</h3>
<p>Miners can maximize profits via pool hopping. This occurs when miners
switch between Pay-per-Share and Proportional scheme mining pools to
whichever payment protocol produces a higher rewards per additional
share. In this scenario, honest and loyal pool miners will be cheated
out of their profits by miners who pool hop and cause inconsistency in
the pool’s hash rate.</p>

&amp; Proportional Pools” style=“width:5in;height:3.9in” /&gt;  </p>
<h3 id="i.ii-pool-cannibalization">I.II Pool Cannibalization</h3>
<p>In this attack, pool miners distribute a small percent of mining
power equally among other pools, without ever submitting valid blocks.
In doing so, we increase personal profits to the detriment of our mining
pools. Pool Cannibalization is very difficult to detect, unless
statistically significant. Since it is more profitable to be dishonest
than honest, miners are incentivized to spend mining power cannibalizing
each other rather than increasing the useful hashrate for finding the
next valid block.</p>
<p>If we model the choice between attacking and not attacking the
Bitcoin network using game theory, we see that the dominant strategy is
for each miner to attack the network, leading to the ultimate detriment
of Bitcoin.</p>

style=“width:6.5in;height:1.36597in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>In this situation, the Nash Equilibrium, or the position from which
no actor can change their position to improve their outcome, is also
known as the Tragedy of the Commons,where each individual actor finds it
individually beneficial to exploit the public good, leading to the
ultimate deterioration of the public good.</p>
<h3 id="ii.-the-double-spend-attack">II. The Double Spend Attack</h3>
<p>The double spend attack occurs when an individual successfully spends
the same value more than once. You can double spend via race attack:</p>
<p>The Race Attack occurs when you trick someone into thinking the
transaction is complete before the transaction even enters a block.</p>
<p>While you can show your victim a valid transaction, you can also send
into the network a conflicting transaction that sends bitcoins from that
same UTXO to an account you control, and incentivize miners to include
this conflicting transaction instead of the first transaction by
offering a higher transaction fee. In other words, you “race” with the
conflicting transaction \to get included in the longest chain.</p>
<p>The Race Attack occurs when you trick someone into thinking the
transaction is complete before the transaction even enters a block.</p>
<p>While you can show your victim a valid transaction, you can also send
into the network a conflicting transaction that sends bitcoins from that
same UTXO to an account you control, and incentivize miners to include
this conflicting transaction instead of the first transaction by
offering a higher transaction fee. In other words, you “race” with the
conflicting transaction \to get included in the longest chain. </p>
<p>To protect against this type of attack, the victim should wait for
kconfirmations, kblocks built off of some particular block. In practice,
kequals 6. If you still want to double spend, you must create a longer
private chain with the same UTXO. If the victim waits kconfirmations,
you must mine k+1blocks upon your private chain and then publish your
private chain to the network, since no one else can see it when it is
private, to complete the Double Spend Attack. Using the following graph,
we can see that if you have over 50 percent of the hashing power, the
probability that you will eventually get a longer chain than the honest
chain is 100 percent, and you will thus successfully conduct a race
attack.</p>

relationship between chains and their lengths”
style=“width:4in;height:2.8in” /&gt;  </p>
<h3 id="iii.-the-51-percent-attack">III. The 51 Percent Attack</h3>
<p>If you, the attacker, have any more than 50 percent of network
hashrate, then you will always be able to double spend because you will
always be able to create the longest chain, and since you would be in
full control of which blocks are included within that chain. Since
individuals on the network would just leave the network when they see a
51 percent attack, and subsequently devalue bitcoin, conducting such an
attack is too risky.</p>
<h3 id="iv.-the-goldfinger-attack">IV. The Goldfinger
Attack<strong> </strong></h3>
<p>The Goldfinger Attack allows attackers to still profit off of the
destruction of Bitcoin. Attackers can “short,” or place a bet on the
devaluation of bitcoin.</p>
<h3 id="v.-censorship">V. Censorship</h3>
<p>In addition to attacking Bitcoin by leveraging hashpower, you can
also attack the network via censorship. With censorship, we can choose
to ignore the transactions from an individual or group of individuals,
isolating them from the network and effectively rendering their bitcoins
useless.</p>
<p>A mining pool with more than 51 percent of the network hashrate can
decide not to work on a chain containing transactions spending from a
particular address. Other miners will see that if they include a
transaction with that address, their block will not be included in the
chain, since the mining pool with the majority hashrate can fork and
create a longer proof-of-work chain. Therefore, they will be
incentivized to exclude the transactions with that address from their
chain. This is called punitive forking.  </p>
<p>Even without 51 percent of the network hashrate, you can censor
another address’ transactions using feather forking. In feather forking,
the attacker announces they will attempt to fork if they see a block
with a certain address’ transactions, but will give up after
kconfirmations. Even though the attacker has a low chance of orphaning,
or excluding, that block, miners will ignore blocks with the given
address. This happens because miners are incentivized primarily by the
profit they expect to earn from mining a particular block. Even if there
is a small chance of the attacker forking a block with the given
address, the math works out such that the expected profit of ignoring
that transaction will exceed that of including it. Thus the victim has
to pay a much higher transaction fee to incentivize miners to include
their transaction.</p>
<h3 id="vi.-selfish-mining">VI. Selfish Mining</h3>
<p>Upon being the first to find a valid block, you can withhold that
block from the network and continue to work on it privately. If you find
two blocks on your secret chain before the network finds the next one,
then you suddenly have the longest chain. This means you get at least
two block rewards and you have fooled the network into working on an
honest chain that you will render useless. You can keep doing this and
submit your longer, secret chain to the network right before you think
the network is going to catch up to you. This is selfish mining.</p>
<h3 id="vii.-defense">VII. Defense</h3>
<p> We discussed several theorized defenses to selfish mining
including</p>

<p>However, according to Vitalik Buterin, “in practice, most Bitcoin
miners act altruistically to support the network, both out of
ideological considerations and because they do not want to destabilize
the source of their own revenue. Such higher-level economic concerns are
beyond the scope of Eyal and Sirer’s paper, but they seriously reduce
the chance that this economic attack will work in practice” (<a

Magazine Opens in new window</a>, 2013).</p>
<h3 id="viii.-the-bitcoin-network">VIII. The Bitcoin Network</h3>
<p>In addition to individual attacks, the architecture of the Bitcoin
network itself contains vulnerabilities. The Bitcoin protocol is P2P, in
which messages get sent via a gossip protocol, where each node passes a
message to its connected nodes. Though we would like an even topology,
this is not the case. Nodes with higher hashrate, perhaps from running
mining pools, may have miners connected to them directly on a
lightweight protocol, or a secret subgraph. Due to this hidden graph
topology, a user could potentially hide that it has more than 50% of the
network hash power.</p>
<p>In addition to network topology, network latency also poses as an
issue. Nodes that are better connected to the network see things faster
and can send out messages and blocks to the network more quickly. This
leads to disproportionate profits in miners.</p>

Revisited” style=“width:5in;height:2.8in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>This module will be the culmination of the last 5 modules.</p>
<p>From here, you will have fully understood all the tenets of how we
build a blockchain system, from the conceptual level to the
implementation.</p>
<p>Our first module examined the basics of Bitcoin, building it from the
ground up with <strong><em><u>four</u></em></strong> key components:
<strong><em>identity, transactions, record-keeping, and
consensus.</em></strong></p>
<p>WIth this high level understanding of Bitcoin, you learned the
motivations for Bitcoin’s design, how Bitcoin provides a previously
centralized service in a decentralized manner, and were then able to
explain Bitcoin in simple terms.</p>
<p>In our second module, we took a step back to look at Bitcoin and
blockchain’s historical context, to get a sense for libertarian ideals
and the Cypherpunk movement, why blockchains are designed as they are,
and the path that current efforts are taking us now.</p>
<p>We then dove into the technical implementation of Bitcoin in our
third module, which used tools such as cryptographic hash functions,
tamper evident data structures, the elliptic curve digital signature
algorithm, and Bitcoin Script.</p>
<p>Through this lecture, you saw features of Bitcoin, such as Merkle
trees and nonces, implementing every concept from Module 1.</p>
<p>In the fourth module, we stepped out of the world of hypotheticals
and theory and looked at how all these concepts played out in real
life.</p>
<p>We examined all the various types of users of Bitcoin and discussed
tools to interact with the network, such as wallets and various
categories of nodes.</p>
<p>The lecture brought Bitcoin to life, allowing you to decide for
yourself how well Satoshi Nakamoto met their mission with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And then finally, last module, we looked at the vulnerabilities of
Bitcoin from a game theoretical standpoint.</p>
<p>Recognizing the costs and implications of both malicious
Proof-of-Work attacks, and that of network latency and topology, we saw
for ourselves Bitcoin’s imperfections.</p>
<p>By completing these 5 lectures, you have now completed your
understanding of Bitcoin fundamentals.</p>
<p>This is only the beginning of your blockchain knowledge.</p>
<p>With these accumulated sets of knowledge, we are now going to take
you from Bitcoin-centric material into a new frame of blockchain
thinking, leveraging all the blockchain knowledge you accumulated while
learning about Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In this module, we’ll be looking at Ethereum and blockchain use
cases.</p>
<h3 id="intro-smart-contracts">Intro: Smart Contracts</h3>
<p>In the past, we talked about how Bitcoin enabled users to conduct
transactions that were decentralized and trustless.</p>
<p>A more general case of this is the execution of arbitrary
computations on the blockchain, and that’s exactly what smart contracts
enable us to do in Ethereum.</p>
<p>We’ve mentioned this before very briefly, saying that Ethereum allows
the creation of decentralized apps, otherwise known as dapps.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll take a look at what smart contracts are at a
high level, and why we might want them.</p>
<p>Then, we’ll look at what we need in a framework that allows us to run
smart contracts.</p>
<p>As we did with Bitcoin, we’ll first look at the high level features
that we want to see in Ethereum – mainly the support of smart contracts
– and then see how they’re implemented at a lower level.</p>

<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image304.jpg" style="width:5in;height:2.81677in" /></p>
<p>First, we have to consider what makes Bitcoin so special.</p>
<p>Understanding what Bitcoin has to offer allows us better to
understand Ethereum’s own value proposition as a smart contract
platform.</p>
<p>Remember in module 1, we built Bitcoin from the ground up, and
emphasized the importance of <strong><em><u>four</u></em></strong> key
components: <strong><em>identity, transactions, record
keeping,</em></strong> and <strong><em>consensus.</em></strong></p>
<p>And it’s the careful design and combination of these components that
really differentiated Bitcoin from anything else at the time.</p>
<p>It turns out that these ideas are much more fundamental than Bitcoin
itself, and will help us understand the key components of Ethereum.</p>
<p>So let’s take some time to review some of what makes Bitcoin so
special.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image306.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8768in" /></p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image307.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81677in" /></p>
<p>First off, when we built Bitcoin from the ground up, we first
emphasized the importance of identity: especially in order to enable
authentication and integrity.</p>
<p>We want everyone to control a unique identity, and we also wanted
Bitcoin to be pseudonymous.</p>
<p>We used ECDSA, the elliptic curve digital signature signature
algorithm.</p>
<p>Bonus points to anyone who remembers the specific name of the
curve.</p>
<p>Users generate their private key at random, or through some hard to
guess manner such as a hashed and key stretched brain wallet
mnemonic.</p>
<p>And then they use one way functions to generate a public-facing
address.</p>
<p>Also remember that Bitcoin is secure since all the numbers we’re
dealing with are massive.</p>
<p>Think back to the grains of sand on earth example in module 1.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image308.png" style="width:5in;height:2.83226in" /></p>
<p>Of course, the main idea of Bitcoin was to be able to send
transactions between users, so naturally, we have a way to do this.</p>
<p>However, the way we did this with Bitcoin was with UTXOs, which
might’ve been not that intuitive at first.</p>
<p>UTXOs made it easier to enable higher degrees of privacy, for
example, if you sent all your change UTXOs to different addresses under
your control.</p>
<p>On the other hand, to calculate your entire balance in bitcoin, you
would have to sum up all your UTXOs.</p>
<p>You’d also potentially have to reference more than one UTXO when
making a transaction, and in some cases this isn’t that desirable.</p>
<p>Still, implementing UTXOs was the innovation that enabled
transactions in Bitcoin, and it works well despite the tradeoffs it
makes.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image309.png" style="width:5in;height:2.83505in" /></p>
<p>Next, of course, we have the blockchain: the famous data structure
that enables record keeping in the network.</p>
<p>Every full node in the network has a copy of the blockchain.</p>
<p>We did this to avoid centralization of power: to avoid having a
central bank, we made everyone the bank.</p>
<p>And the blockchain is constructed in a tamper evident manner too.</p>
<p>Each block in the blockchain refers to the hash of the previous
block’s header.</p>
<p>And also, within each block, we construct a merkle root, which is a
tamper evident “summary” of all the transactions in that block.</p>
<p>Any time a previous transaction is altered in the blockchain that
changes the transaction’s hash, which bubbles up to change the merkle
root, which then changes the block header hash.</p>
<p>This then invalidates the block, since all blocks refer to the
previous block hash</p>
<p>With the blockchain, we have an efficient way to not only store data,
but also to make sure that the data is tamper evident: and this is
crucial especially since we’re deploying this for the public, where we
can’t expect everyone to be honest.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image310.png" style="width:5in;height:2.80284in" /></p>
<p>And finally, we have Proof-of-Work consensus.</p>
<p>Nodes on the Bitcoin network needed a way to come to consensus on
updates to the blockchain, so we implemented a voting system.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t as easy as assigning each user a single vote,
since it’s so easy to generate new identities.</p>
<p>We saw the need to assign weights to our votes.</p>
<p>The innovation here was to have everyone solve a cryptographic hash
puzzle, incentivized by block reward.</p>
<p>And whoever solved the cryptographic hash puzzle first, and provided
proof that they solved it correctly, would propose the new update to the
blockchain.</p>
<p>And the more compute power you had, the more likely you’d solve the
hash puzzle first and get to propose the new block.</p>
<p>Voting power is limited by compute power – a physical limitation –
rather than by the number of identities a user holds.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image311.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81677in" /></p>
<p>And by carefully designing Bitcoin like that, we have all these nice
benefits:</p>
<p>Bitcoin is <strong>pseudonymous</strong>.</p>
<p>Cryptographic identities allow for integrity and authentication,
meaning also that we have accountability – for example if someone tries
to double spend or do something malicious, we can catch that.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is <strong>democratic</strong>, in that decisions made
through Proof-of-Work consensus don’t require you to trust anybody else
on the network.</p>
<p>You just have to trust the math behind consensus, and that there’s an
honest majority on the network, so the network proceeds in a healthy
manner.</p>
<p>Also, we can see that the blockchain is an <strong>immutable</strong>
ledger of truth.</p>
<p>Everyone sees the same version of the truth since we have
consensus.</p>
<p>And we also have tamper evident data structures in place so that no
one can just go in and change history.</p>
<p>Bitcoin was also designed to be <strong>uncensorable</strong>.</p>
<p>To censor transactions, you would have to control a large proportion
of the network, and for any one party, this would be considerably
difficult.</p>
<p>Finally, Bitcoin is <strong>distributed</strong>.</p>
<p>There’s no central point of failure.</p>
<p>Instead, the execution of transactions depends on a network of miners
located around the world.</p>
<p>All these properties seem pretty nice, and it would be awesome if we
could include them in our smart contract platform.</p>
<p>So, we’ll keep Bitcoin’s architecture in mind.</p>

<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image312.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81677in" /></p>
<p>Now that we have these design considerations, we can take a look at
smart contracts, and how they fall into this whole space.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, we can look at the definition of the word
“contract”.</p>
<p>A contract is a written or spoken agreement that is intended to be
enforced by law.</p>
<p>Notice specifically that a contract must be agreed upon, and that it
is enforceable by law.</p>
<p>So just by these words alone, it sounds like we need some sort of
consensus going on in our smart contract system.</p>
<p>And through consensus, we should be able to agree on both the
contents of the contract, and also the execution of the contract.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image313.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81677in" /></p>
<p>Alright, so now that we know what a contract is, now the question
is…what makes a smart contract so “smart?”</p>
<p>A <strong>smart contract</strong> is a piece of code that
facilitates, verifies, or enforces the negotiation or execution of a
digital contract.</p>
<p>For us to reach consensus, a trusted entity must run this code.</p>
<p>After all, we need to trust that a digital contract is enforced
correctly.</p>
<p>Like a traditional contract, it carries a set of conditions that must
be fulfilled, or terms that must be executed on.</p>
<p>The difference is that the execution and enforcement is done through
carefully designed algorithms, not through law.</p>
<h3 id="intro-ethereum">Intro: Ethereum</h3>
<p>Looking first at what makes Bitcoin special, and the underlying
architecture that makes it the way it is, we saw how we could keep
bitcoins design philosophy in mind as we sought ways to design a smart
contract platform.</p>

<p>In the next sections, we’ll take a look at Ethereum.</p>
<p>We’ve mentioned it throughout the course thus far.</p>
<p>From what we know so far, Ethereum is a technology upon which people
have built countless applications, ranging from decentralized autonomous
organizations to online markets for digital kittens.</p>
<p>But now we can finally ask, what exactly is Ethereum and how does it
work?</p>
<p>As it turns out, leveraging our understanding of Bitcoin’s inner
workings makes understanding Ethereum a whole lot more accessible.</p>
<h3 id="high-level-overview">High Level Overview</h3>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image316.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81677in" /></p>
<p>Just like Bitcoin, Ethereum is a platform that’s constantly
changing.</p>
<p>It’s under active development by not only the official Ethereum
Foundation team, but also by its large open source community.</p>
<p>Over the years, it’s been shaped by current events and its
community.</p>
<p>And the software improvements and proposals over the years are, like
in Bitcoin, a testament to the large user base and also the democratic
nature of the software.</p>
<p>As more and more people begin to use Ethereum to build applications,
Ethereum needs to adapt more and more.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image317.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8125in" /></p>
<p>On their website, it says Ethereum is a decentralized platform
designed to run smart contracts.</p>
<p>In short, it’s a distributed computer spread amongst a multitude of
nodes across the world that executes code that people feed to it.</p>
<p>And because of this architecture, it can run unstoppable
applications.</p>
<p>Applications are run exactly as programmed, without any possibility
of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party intervention. It uses a
blockchain, and its blockchain is account-based, instead of UTXO-based
like Bitcoin.</p>
<p>We’ll into more detail about this in a bit.</p>
<p>Formally, Ethereum is implemented as a distributed state machine, and
transactions on the network change the global state of the system.</p>
<p>Nodes in Ethereum keep track of and come to consensus on the global
system state – which includes data about who owns what.</p>
<p>Execution of transactions bring us from a previous state to a new
state, so they’re the state transition functions.</p>
<p>Ethereum’s native asset is ether, which is the basis of value in the
Ethereum ecosystem, and is also crucial in aligning incentives.</p>

<p>So as a recap from the previous section, what makes Bitcoin so
special are the following properties: it’s trustless, immutable,
uncensorable, pseudonymous, has no central point of failure, and aims
for a one-cpu-one-vote policy.</p>
<p>Ethereum has all of these, but has a different use case.</p>
<p>Before the creation of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, the creator of
Ethereum had argued that Bitcoin needed a more general purpose scripting
language, but he didn’t get much support for his proposal.</p>
<p>So, he made Ethereum.</p>
<p>And one of the most notable features is that it supports a turing
complete scripting language.</p>
<h3 id="ethereum-vs-bitcoin">Ethereum vs Bitcoin</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image319.png" style="width:5in;height:2.81677in" /></p>
<p>Ethereum and Bitcoin are the two most popular blockchain platforms in
the world today, but have two different goals.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is the “gold standard” of blockchains.</p>
<p>It’s been around for the longest, and its protocol has successfully
supported an enormous number of transactions over the past years.</p>
<p>It’s intended purpose is solely to allow the transaction of bitcoins,
its native asset.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ethereum is a smart contract blockchain platform,
a distributed world computer.</p>
<p>It’s native asset ether exists to fund computation and to align
incentives.</p>
<p>Its primary purpose is not to act as a medium of exchanging
value.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is simple and robust.</p>
<p>It’s a global payment system.</p>
<p>That’s all it really sets out to do.</p>
<p>Ethereum has a much larger vision, and therefore supports many more
features, for example, a much more powerful scripting language.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has a stack based primitive scripting language which is not
turing complete, meaning that the applications we can make on Bitcoin
are pretty limited.</p>
<p>Ethereum on the other hand has a Turing-complete scripting language –
one of the motivating factors for Ethereum’s creation in the first
place.</p>
<p>So, a wider variety of applications can be made on Ethereum than on
Bitcoin, making it more developer friendly.</p>
<p>Another key difference is that Bitcoin is UTXO-based, whereas
Ethereum is account based.</p>
<h3 id="ethereum-features">Ethereum Features</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image320.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8125in" /></p>
<p>In Bitcoin, private keys prove ownership of UTXOs.</p>
<p>When you spend bitcoin, you spend from previous transactions.</p>
<p>And to calculate your current balance, you have to sum up all the
UTXOs that you own.</p>
<p>The reason Bitcoin uses UTXOs is that they make it easy to make
transactions and prevent double spending.</p>
<p>Think back to the piggy bank analogy from module 1.</p>
<p>In Ethereum, private keys prove ownership of an account, which tracks
a current balance.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image321.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8125in" /></p>
<p>Accounts are more space efficient than UTXOs, since to calculate your
balance, you only have to reference your account, rather than summing
across all your UTXOs.</p>
<p>Also, since our ultimate goal is to support smart contracts, it’s
much cheaper and easier to look up an account balance and also transfer
between accounts when we have an account model rather than a UTXO
model.</p>
<p>In Ethereum, there are two types of accounts: externally owned
accounts and contract accounts.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image322.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8125in" /></p>
<p>Externally owned accounts are, as their name implies, owned by some
external entity – outside of the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>This could be a person, group of people, a corporation, or something
else.</p>
<p>Externally owned accounts contain an address that they use to let
people send them ether, and also a balance of ether.</p>
<p>This type of account can send transactions to transfer ether or to
trigger contract code, which lives in contract accounts.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image323.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8125in" /></p>
<p>Contract accounts are owned by smart contracts.</p>
<p>They contain an address, associated contract code, and also
persistent storage.</p>
<p>Their code is executed when externally owned accounts or other
contract accounts make transactions to trigger their code’s function
calls.</p>
<p>Smart contracts in Ethereum are like autonomous agents that live
inside of the Ethereum network, whereas regular users controlling
externally owned accounts are not.</p>
<p>Smart contracts react to the external world when they are poked by
transactions, which call specific functions.</p>
<p>Smart contracts have direct control over an internal ether balance,
internal contract state, and also permanent storage.</p>
<p><img src="/images/image324.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8125in" /></p>
<p>Ethereum smart contracts generally serve four main purposes.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>They can be used to store and maintain data.</li>
</ol>
<p>The data representing something useful to users or other
contracts.</p>
<p>For example, there could be a smart contract defining a new token
currency, or perhaps a certain organization’s membership, which you have
to pay a certain amount to obtain.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Smart contracts can also be used to manage a contract or
relationship between untrusting users.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is perhaps the most easily understood use of smart contracts, as
it’s just running a regular contract but on the distributed Ethereum
network.</p>
<p>For example, you could have smart contracts that manage financial
contracts, escrow, or insurance.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Smart contracts can also provide additional functionality to other
contracts.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can write contracts that call other contracts, perhaps using them
as a software library, leveraging the functionality of an existing
contract.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>And finally, smart contracts can be used for complex authentication
use cases.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, you can define m of n multisignature, which is also
something we looked at when we studied Bitcoin.</p>

<p>We’ve seen how smart contracts can be expressed in code, but how are
they executed on the Ethereum network?</p>
<p>What happens under the hood that enables the distributed and
decentralized execution of smart contracts?</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll be looking at the Ethereum Virtual Machine –
the heart of Ethereum – which enables the Ethereum blockchain to be
programmable.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-ethereum-virtual-machine">Understanding Ethereum
Virtual Machine</h3>
<p><img src="/images/image332.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8125in" /></p>
<p>Ethereum smart contracts are generally written in high level
programming languages.</p>
<p>The most popular is Solidity, which kind of looks like a mix between
C++ and JavaScript.</p>
<p>There’s also Vyper, which is a newer language that’s currently under
development.</p>
<p>Smart contracts written in these high level programming languages
have to be compiled down to Ethereum Virtual Machine code, abbreviated
as EVM code.</p>
<p>We go from a higher level, human readable language, and compile that
down into EVM code, which is lower level, simpler language – much easier
for a machine to understand and execute.</p>
<p><img src="/images/image333.png" style="width:5in;height:2.85621in" /></p>
<p>After the code is compiled to EVM code, every node in the Ethereum
network executes it.</p>
<p>And all nodes execute the code the same way, so long as they have an
up-to-date version of the EVM software.</p>
<p>We say that Ethereum is a distributed computer because every node
executes the Ethereum smart contracts.</p>
<p>Nodes then come to consensus on the new system state.</p>
<p>This should be fairly familiar.</p>
<p><img src="/images/image334.png" style="width:5in;height:2.83226in" /></p>
<p>In module 1, the high-level overview of Bitcoin, we discussed how
every full node in Bitcoin stores their own ledger, making everyone the
bank.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, nodes come to consensus on the state of who owns which
UTXOs.</p>
<p><img src="/images/image335.png" style="width:5in;height:2.84505in" /></p>
<p>And in Ethereum…</p>
<p>…after executing EVM code, nodes come to consensus on the general
state of the network.</p>
<p>And how do nodes actually come to consensus?</p>
<p><img src="/images/image336.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8275in" /></p>
<p>With Proof-of-Work!</p>
<p>That’s right.</p>
<p>The same distributed consensus protocol used in Bitcoin is also used
in Ethereum.</p>
<p>Of course, there ARE differences between Ethereum’s and Bitcoin’s
Proof-of-Work implementations, but the general concepts that we have
learned in the past modules definitely still apply.</p>
<p><img src="/images/image337.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8534in" /></p>
<p>Remember that Proof-of-Work requires miners to expend computational
power to increase their chances of being able to propose blocks to the
network.</p>
<p>There’s no real smart way to go about solving the hash puzzle, so
miners have to brute force.</p>
<p>And by tying voting power to computational power, a physical
real-world resource, we can prevent naive Sybil attacks.</p>
<p><img src="/images/image338.png" style="width:5in;height:2.84416in" /></p>
<p>Here are some differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s
Proof-of-Work algorithms.</p>
<p>In Ethereum, block creation time is 15 seconds long, whereas in
Bitcoin, it’s 10 minutes.</p>
<p>This allows execution of smart contracts to be done and finalized
fairly quickly.</p>
<p>However, having such fast block times does increase the rate of
natural forks and orphaned blocks, but this is accounted for in
Ethereum’s protocol.</p>
<p>In previous modules, we studied Bitcoin’s proof of work algorithm,
and how it’s bound by computation and uses sha-256.</p>
<p>In Ethereum, the proof of work algorithm is called Ethash.</p>
<p>Ethash is memory bound and claims to be ASIC resistant.</p>
<p>And over on the right side, we can see a graph of Ethereum’s network
hash rate, which is significantly lower than that of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>As of May 23rd, 2018, Ethereum has roughly 275,000 GH/s whereas
Bitcoin has a whopping 31,000,000 TH/s</p>
<h3 id="ethereum-virtual-machine-overview">Ethereum Virtual Machine:
Overview</h3>
<p><img src="/images/image339.png" style="width:5in;height:2.83679in" /></p>
<p>Miners in Ethereum competitively create blocks by executing EVM code
and searching for a solution to a mining puzzle.</p>
<p>And just like before, Proof-of-Work is a competition, and only one
miner is able to add a block to the Ethereum blockchain, and claim the
associated reward.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Work is essentially a way to randomly select – based on
proportion of hash power – one node’s execution result as the correct
one to add to the blockchain.</p>
<p><img src="/images/image340.png" style="width:5in;height:2.83679in" /></p>
<p>Every Ethereum node runs the Ethereum Virtual Machine as part of its
block verification procedure.</p>
<p>As before, network consensus removes the need for a trusted third
party.</p>
<p>In order to violate smart contracts, you would have to subvert the
entire network.</p>
<p>This enables peer-to-peer agreements that live on the blockchain
forever.</p>
<p>Contract code is run by the Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM for
short, as we mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Contract code is compiled down, and the code that actually gets
executed on every node is EVM code.</p>
<p>And EVM code is a low-level stack based bytecode language.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with the JVM, it’s like how JVM languages such as
Java, Scala, and Groovy all compile down to JVM bytecode.</p>
<p>The fact that we can compile complex smart contract code into simple
machine understandable instructions in the form of EVM code that all
nodes in the network can execute in the same deterministic way provides
the basis for consensus in Ethereum.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------  ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image341.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8125in" /></p>
<p>Because every node in the Ethereum network is executing smart
contracts, one imimageste issue we face is: What if a contract has an
infinite loop?</p>
<p>All of a sudden, this contract is pushed onto the Ethereum network,
and someone calls the function foo, which has an infinite loop in it,
and all nodes see this transaction and start executing foo –
forever.</p>
<p>Every node on the network would be stuck executing this infinite
loop.</p>
<p>And by the halting problem, a well-known problem in computability
theory, we know that it’s impossible to determine ahead of time whether
a given contract will ever terminate.</p>
<p>And all of this leads to a very easy way for attackers to launch
denial of service attacks:</p>
by trapping computers around the world in an infinite loop, thereby
making them unable to execute other more meaningful contracts.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------  ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image342.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8125in" /></p>
<p>Luckily, the developers of Ethereum thought of this and implemented a
solution: in the form of what’s known as gas.</p>
<p>Gas is what fuels the execution of a given contract.</p>
<p>Every EVM op-code requires gas in order to execute – thereby
preventing the aforementioned infinite loop denial of service
attack.</p>
Every transaction specifies two parameters,
“<strong><em>startgas</em></strong>”, or the maximum quantity of gas the
transaction is willing to consume, and the
“<strong><em>gasprice</em></strong>”, or the fee in ether the contract
is willing to pay per unit gas.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------  ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image343.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8125in" /></p>
<p>At the start of a transaction, “startgas * gasprice”, which
represents the amount of ether paid for a computation, is subtracted
from the sender’s account.</p>
<p>The sender being the one who invokes the contract by sending a
transaction.</p>
<p>If the contract successfully executes, then the remaining gas is
refunded to the sender.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the contract execution runs out of gas before
it finishes, then the execution reverts.</p>
<p>However, the amount in ether that was consumed is not refunded.</p>
<p>The idea here is that although the contract execution gets reverted,
someone on the network had to put in the computational power to execute
the EVM code, and once the gas is spent up, it’s proof that someone
executed the program, so it isn’t refunded.</p>
This gives us two end states: either a program terminates or runs out of
gas.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------  ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image344.png" style="width:5in;height:2.83398in" /></p>
<p>Ethereum still allows someone to write an infinite loop in a smart
contract.</p>
<p>However, the attacker attempting to DoS the network has to pay enough
ether to fund the DoS</p>
<p>In a way, you can think of purchasing gas as the price you have to
pay to use this distributed, trustless computational power.</p>
<p>This thereby disincentivizes users from running expensive
computations without having sufficient funds.</p>
Since each computation requires gas, an attacker looking to DoS the
network would need an absurdly large amount of ether, and since the
attack is so costly, that pretty much disincentivizes this sort of
attack.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------  ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image345.png" style="width:5in;height:2.79754in" /></p>
<p>We mentioned that nodes come to consensus on the network state, and
that code execution on the EVM changes the state.</p>
<p>In a way, you can think of the EVM as the underlying state transition
mechanism.</p>
<p>When we execute a transaction, we go from a previous state to a new
state.</p>
<p>At the beginning, there was a blank Genesis state, upon which many
transactions were executed.</p>
<p>And at any point in time, the final state represents the current
state of the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>You start with the current block state, the gas required, the current
memory, the transaction that’s calling a contract, a message which
basically contains transaction metadata, the code of the contract, and
the stack and program counter.</p>
<p>Basically, everything you need to correctly execute a
transaction.</p>
<p>And you feed this into the EVM, and get out the new block state, with
all the updated account balances and internal state, and the new gas
value, which gets refunded.</p>

<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image347.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8125in" /></p>
<p>So, some conclusions about Ethereum’s high level architecture.</p>
<p>Ethereum’s main goal is not to optimize computational efficiency, but
to enable distributed and trustless computation.</p>
<p>Every node on the network has to run the same computations, so
Ethereum is redundantly parallel.</p>
<p>And this is all to efficiently reach consensus on the system state
without needing trusted third parties.</p>
<p>And because contract executions are redundantly replicated across all
nodes, execution is expensive.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------  ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image348.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8125in" /></p>
<p>For example, you shouldn’t be training machine learning models or
doing anything else computationally expensive directly on smart
contracts.</p>
<p>So hopefully this creates an incentive not to use the blockchain for
computation that can be done off chain.</p>
<h3 id="intro-ethereum-use-cases">Intro: Ethereum Use Cases</h3>
<p>In this next section, we’ll go over both basic and advanced use cases
enabled by smart contracts.</p>
<p>In these use cases, we will present how we can leverage a particular
blockchain property to accomplish something not previously possible.</p>
<p>This is not a necessarily a stamp of approval on the use case, but an
opportunity for us to demonstrate the unique and meaningful features
provided by a blockchain.</p>
<h3 id="basic-use-cases-smart-assets">Basic Use Cases: Smart Assets</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------  ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image349.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8125in" /></p>
<p>The first use case imaginable is a smart asset, or token, built on
top of a currently existing blockchain.</p>
<p>This is literally building your own currency on top of another
currency.</p>
<p>All that needs to be done is to ensure that a user who wants to spend
money has the funds, has been authenticated, and is not double
spending.</p>
<p>Authentication and double spending protocols are both built into
Ethereum , so the only piece of logic that the smart contract needs to
handle is checking for funds.</p>
<p>Thus, it only requires two main features to be functional: a storage
structure for associating addresses with assets, and a send() function
to transfer assets.</p>
<p>An example of the send() function is shown below, written in
Solidity, a popular contract oriented, high level EVM language for
implementing smart contracts.</p>
<p>This demonstrates that building an app on top of the Ethereum
blockchain allows you to tap into the currently existing blockchain
protocol and procedures.</p>
<p>All that the user needs to provide is the basic, secure logic to
bring their desired blockchain use case to life.</p>
<p>It should be noted now that building functional smart contracts and
building secure ones are two completely different things.</p>
<p>Securing smart contracts is incredibly tough, as you may have figured
out from recent news about smart contract hacks.</p>
<h3 id="basic-use-cases-multisig">Basic Use Cases: Multisig</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------  ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image350.png" style="width:5in;height:2.79727in" /></p>
<p>Another meaningful use case for smart contracts is multisignature
wallets.</p>
<p>Remember back to the multisig script from module 3.</p>
<p>Now, we can include that same functionality in a human-readable
manner in Ethereum.</p>
<p>Here, we’re able to leverage the built-in authentication protocols to
build a multiparty authentication wallet.</p>
<p>This functionality allows us to have an m of n signature scheme, in
which m addresses out of a total n owners of the wallet are required to
sign off on every transaction.</p>
<p>This ensures that no one person has control over funds.</p>
<p>Even though the logic is reasonably easy to describe, the Solidity
implementation is pretty complex.</p>
<p>A company that created multisig wallets, Parity, was hacked twice
last year due to undiscovered vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The shown code on the right is the constructor for the contract,
establishing the threshold and owners.</p>
<p>The value of threshold corresponds to m, and the number of owners
represents n.</p>
<h3 id="basic-use-cases-proof-of-existence">Basic Use Cases: Proof of
Existence</h3>

<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image351.png" style="width:5in;height:2.78969in" /></p>
<p>Let’s say we came up with an amazing new tech buzzword, “3D printing
artificial intelligence on the blockchain.”</p>
<p>We wanted to prove that we came up with it before some date, but we
don’t yet want to reveal the buzzword to the public.</p>
<p>How do we do this in a way that everyone trusts?</p>
<p>Well, by combining hash functions and the trustless blockchain!</p>
<p>We store a hash of our document onto the blockchain.</p>
<p>By doing so, we can prove to everyone at any later date that we were
the ones who included that hash on the blockchain, and that our
information has not been changed.</p>
<p>By doing so, we have now “proved the existence” of some piece of
information at some point in time.</p>
<p>With Proof-of-Existence, we leverage both the public auditability and
immutability of the blockchain.</p>
<p>With a blockchain, we can cryptographically prove commitment to some
particular value.</p>
<p>This is nothing more than a record-keeping use case, and there are
several which fall under this category.</p>
<p>One of these use cases is document ownership.</p>
<p>We can prove that we own some document at some time through a
commitment scheme: hash the document with some random number, then you
have your hash commitment.</p>
<p>Reveal the inputs later to prove your ownership.</p>

<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image352.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8125in" /></p>
<p>In addition, there’s the opportunity to implement a decentralized DNS
system.</p>
<p>“DNS” stands for “Domain Name System,” and its one purpose is to
associate URLs with IP addresses.</p>
<p>Our browsers look to trusted DNS servers to provide this service, but
why not put this service on a trustless database?</p>
<p>In a smart contract, we can easily design a scheme that creates
associations between names and values.</p>
<p>We’ll expand on how we take advantage of these properties in the
Advanced Use Cases section.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-use-cases-land-titles">Advanced Use Cases: Land
Titles</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------  ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image353.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8125in" /></p>
<p>A problem that several underdeveloped countries face is a broken land
titles system.</p>
<p>Flawed paperwork, forged signatures, and unclear documents make it
difficult to trace the ownership of land.</p>
<p>In addition, it’s difficult for these governments to build
infrastructure for each of their citizens.</p>
<p>The pitfalls which keep a central organization from solving this
problem are mistrust between citizens and these central parties.</p>
<p>Corrupt officials are susceptible to bribes and have tampered records
countless times.</p>
<p>Also, the government does not have the resources to oversee so large
a project when it does not bring in a substantial amount of revenue.</p>
<p>In addition, most citizens do not trust non-governmental
organizations either, making all centralized options infeasible.</p>
<p>So how do we solve this problem?</p>
<p>Well, let’s try a decentralized approach.</p>
<p>What do we include in our decentralized approach?</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------  ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p><img src="/images/image354.png" style="width:5in;height:2.8125in" /></p>
<p>Well, what we’re doing here is tracking ownership of documents,
similar to Proof-of-Existence.</p>
<p>We can create an association between users and document hashes.</p>
<p>By associating addresses to document hashes, users can provide
digital signatures to prove ownership.</p>
<p>This provides transparency and immutability, since information about
all document ownership is public on the blockchain, and also limits
centralization because no single entity decides which person owns which
titles.</p>
Just like transferring bitcoin between users through UTXOs, we’re simply
transferring the land title through smart contracts as well.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!--------------------------------- Decentralized Land Titles ------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image344.png”Decentralized Land Titles”
style=“width:5in;height:2.85in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>However, there’s a big caveat that affects this blockchain use case,
along with several others that link real world information to digital
information.</p>
<p>In the computer science world, most are familiar with the acronym
“GIGO,” which means “Garbage In, Garbage Out.”</p>
<p>A blockchain is good at handling internal data through its public
auditability, but it can’t reach into the real world and validate
inputs.</p>
<p>If the inputs from the real world are incorrect, then the output is
also going to be incorrect.</p>
<p>This implies some system for validating inputs into the blockchain –
we refer to such entities sending information from the real world into
the blockchain as “oracles.”</p>
<p>However, this drives us back towards centralization, since we need
some trusted third party to serve as an oracle to provide information
into the blockchain whenever someone creates a land title.</p>
<p>This problem has yet to be solved.</p>
<p>Georgia, Ukraine, and Sweden are a few of the major countries
tackling decentralized land titles, and several companies are seeking to
make decentralized oracle systems as well.</p>

<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image345.png”Prediction Markets: Draws on the
Wisdom of the Crowd” style=“width:5in;height:2.85in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>A prediction market allows users to bet on the future and receive
winnings if they bet correctly.</p>
<p>An example of this is the Presidential Election: PredictIt.org gave
anyone the opportunity to bet on whether Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton,
or another candidate would win the election.</p>
The organization would then decide on what happened, and pay out to
users as specified.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image346.png”Prediction Markets: Transparent
&amp; Never Crashes” style=“width:5in;height:2.85in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>However, with a central organization, we depend both on the
organization to provide honest information about payouts and to
truthfully act on political events.</p>
<p>In addition, the central organization is the only producer of
markets, and it is able to censor users as desired.</p>
<p>How can we guarantee a fully open system?</p>
<p>If we seek to perform this with a decentralized system, how can we
make this happen?</p>
<p>That’s exactly what smart contract platforms are for: letting you
leverage the underlying blockchain protocol without having creating it
from scratch.</p>
<p>We can tap into the censorship-resistant and trustless blockchain
protocol and write smart contracts to handle the market logic.</p>
<p>Anyone can create and participate in a market.</p>
<p>In addition, execution of this logic is all public, giving guarantees
that all funds have been distributed as intended.</p>
Gnosis and Augur are two well-known companies that have deployed
prediction market smart contracts.

style=“width:5in;height:2.85in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>What can we do with these prediction markets?</p>
<p>An easy way to use them is to, quite simply, see predictions.</p>
<p>We can use prediction markets to “buy information.”</p>
<p>As users have an incentive to monetize information while revealing as
little of it as possible, we can set up a prediction market which asks a
simple question, such as…</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------- Prediction Markets: And Decentralizing Them ---------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image348.png”Prediction Markets: And
Decentralizing Them” style=“width:5in;height:2.85in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>Will this movie be a flop?</p>
<p>By putting this in a prediction market, we can get a sense for the
general audience’s perspective on some movie, paying them if they bet
correctly.</p>
<p>Hollywood insiders, for example, would be particularly drawn to this,
as they can leverage their immense store of knowledge to make money for
themselves.</p>
This allows the person asking the question to gather information while
letting users keep specifics to themselves.

<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image349.png”Prediction Markets: Other Use
Cases” style=“width:5in;height:2.85in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>Other use cases include insurance, bug bounties, and ICO
signaling.</p>
<p>The first market for insurance is a way to let users prepare against
disasters through crowdfunding, and the second two are ways to
incentivize certain actions, such as the honest exposure of bug
bounties.</p>
If a user notices a bug in a smart contract, they can heavily bet “yes”
before revealing the vulnerability, allowing them to reap the rewards of
their hidden knowledge.

Cryptoeconomics” style=“width:5in;height:2.85in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>An exciting use case of prediction markets is futarchy.</p>
<p>Futarchy is a system of government controlled by prediction
markets.</p>
<p>The typical slogan is “Vote Values, but Bet Beliefs,” as futarchy
aims to give citizens the power to put their money where their mouth
is.</p>
<p>Elected representatives will define and manage national welfare.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, citizens who more often predict the outcome of some policy
will be rewarded, and the rest will lose money.</p>
<p>Eventually, only the regularly successful will bet, meaning that
policies will be decided by those with the most knowledge.</p>
<p>Research is still being done to examine the feasibility of futarchy
on a blockchain, particularly by Gnosis.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------------- Supply Chain and Provenance ----------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image351.png”Supply Chain and Provenance”
style=“width:5in;height:2.85in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>A popular conception is that blockchain is the perfect solution for
supply chain.</p>
<p>However, we’ll see here that there are quite a few caveats when using
blockchain to solve supply chain.</p>
<p>One problem that the world faces today is the use of diamonds to fund
rebel groups against governments.</p>
<p>Such diamonds are referred to as conflict diamonds, or “blood
diamonds.”</p>
<p>The Kimberley Process is a governmental effort requiring participants
to certify the origin of their diamond.</p>
<p>However, there are some potential issues with the system, which
include corrupt officials taking bribes to validate or sign
certifications, and the masking of actual trails by complex supply
chains.</p>
<p>Everledger was created to solve this problem using blockchain
technology, specifically leveraging Hyperledger.</p>
<p>This company tokenizes every diamond and tracks its movement on the
blockchain as individuals trade.</p>
<p>At any point in time, someone can cross-reference the blockchain to
see the diamond’s path from mining to current product.</p>
<p>There are some caveats however, which include the issue of
representing real world data on the blockchain.</p>
<p>We have to trust that individuals are not bribed to include false
information in the blockchain, and we also have to trust that the
identifier of the diamond was not tampered with in the process.</p>

<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image352.png”Smart Energy Grids: Revolutionizing
Infrastructure” style=“width:5in;height:2.85in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>Thus far, we’ve mentioned how we can provide a digital service using
a blockchain.</p>
<p>However, what about the situation in which we want to provide a real
world service, leveraging a blockchain to make it happen?</p>
<p>Onesp of the biggest scenarios is infrastructure.</p>
<p>In hundreds of countries, infrastructure is one of its defining
qualities.</p>
<p>Japan and Germany, for example, have world-renowned
infrastructure.</p>
<p>But what happens if a country’s government cannot, or will not, build
for its citizens?</p>
<p>This could be because of a lack of capital, or simply a lack of
desire.</p>
<p>In this scenario, it’s hard to find a central party that will
collaborate on the behalf of citizens.</p>
<p>This is where a blockchain comes in.</p>
<p>A common infrastructure problem is that of smart energy grids.</p>
<p>Energy can transfer from a plant to a house, but what if a house has
excess energy?</p>
<p>Let’s say House A has excess energy, and House C lacks energy.</p>
<p>How can we build infrastructure from House A to C without relying on
a central party?</p>
<p>The solution is in smart contracts.</p>
<p>We can make promises through smart contracts to guarantee our
financial commitment to a project.</p>
<p>House A can create a smart contract, put in $10,000, and say that, if
both House B and House C also commit $10,000, then a contractor can
redeem that money in exchange for working on this smart energy grid.</p>
<p>This immutable commitment scheme allows anyone to leverage smart
money properties to the fullest.</p>
<p>Through smart contracts, we can coordinate between untrusting parties
without a central entity.</p>
<p>In places where the government can’t or won’t contribute to the
quality of life for citizens, they’re now able to do it themselves if
they have the capital but not yet the system to securely combine their
resources.</p>
<p>This is one of the most revolutionary concepts in blockchain, giving
users the ability to be their own service providers.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-use-cases-after-hours-trading">Advanced Use Cases:
After Hours Trading</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------- After Hours Trading: 24/7 Access & Liquidity ---------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image353.png”After Hours Trading: 24/7 Access
&amp; Liquidity” style=“width:5in;height:2.85in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>The final use case we’re going to examine is after hours trading.</p>
<p>After hours trading refers to the case of trading stocks during
unconventional hours.</p>
<p>In the days before global connectivity, stock trading was limited to
daytime hours, from 9:30 AM to 4 PM EST.</p>
<p>This artificial restraint perpetuated into the Digital Age.</p>
<p>So, what’s stopping us from enabling after hours trading today?</p>
<p>The problem is a lack of liquidity.</p>
<p>With a lack of liquidity comes an increase of volatility, implying an
increase of risk.</p>
<p>As the SEC aims to reduce risk for investors, the options for after
hours trading are limited to limit orders.</p>
<p>These types of orders are not guaranteed to execute, only going
through if some stock value is above some minimum or below some max,
depending on the type of order.</p>
<p>The solution?</p>
<p>Tokenize the stocks.</p>
<p>Put the marketplace on the blockchain instead.</p>
<p>We can tokenize the stocks by asking a broker to underwrite the stock
token.</p>
<p>The contract will say, “Anyone who owns this stock token can come to
me, the broker, to exchange the token for the physical corresponding
stock.”</p>
<p>This tie between the token and real world assets will provide the
tokens with tangible value, and the global properties of a blockchain
will allow that stock to be traded around the world, unrestrained by
social constructs.</p>
<p>The most important part of the blockchain, however, is the
accessibility.</p>
<p>Any broker can tap into this market, allowing for the trustless
pooling of these stock tokens across the board.</p>
<p>By coordinating between these untrusting parties on a globally
accessible platform, the liquidity problem will have been solved in a
way that’s unfeasible for centralized solutions.</p>
<h3 id="blockchain-vs-internet">Blockchain vs Internet</h3>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------------- Blockchain vs The Internet ------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image354.png”Blockchain vs The Internet”
style=“width:5in;height:2.85in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>In almost every conversation about blockchain’s role in society or
path going forward, you’ll hear a comparison to the Internet.</p>
<p>You’ll hear about how the Internet took 20 years to flesh out
meaningful use cases, about how several companies sprung up during the
Dot Com boom only to fade out as the few significant startups survived,
about how blockchain is an Internet of Value as opposed to
information.</p>
<p>So, what’s a full comparison of blockchain versus the Internet?</p>
<p>First, we know that both blockchain technology and the Internet
describe protocols for connectivity.</p>
<p>However, the type of connectivity differs.</p>
<p>With the Internet, you now have the capability to connect to anyone
of your choice to securely share information.</p>
<p>The only people who need to see this information are the two parties
involved in the exchange, and there only needs to be some path for
information to flow between them.</p>
<p>With blockchain, you now have the capability to connect with anyone
to securely share value, but the exchange of value must be observed by
everyone on the network.</p>
<p>If you didn’t have the public validating transactions, then
blockchain protocols would be meaningless.</p>
<p>Whereas, with the Internet, it doesn’t matter who else is on the
network as long as each individual is able to communicate with its
relevant parties.</p>
<p>Second, the way in which blockchain and the Internet manifested also
differs.</p>
<p>The Internet was a project developed by academics.</p>
<p>The first message over the Internet was sent was between UCLA and
Stanford research labs.</p>
<p>From the world of academia, the Internet arrived to the corporate and
public worlds.</p>
<p>Blockchain, however, started differently.</p>
<p>A grassroots movement, Bitcoin was an open-source project between
libertarian advocates first and foremost, and the first Bitcoin
transaction was between anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto and Hal Finney, a
cypherpunk and developer for the PGP Corporation.</p>
<p>From there, Bitcoin and blockchain started to move into the realms of
academia and enterprise.</p>
<p>Third, the social environment developed around these projects differs
immensely because of both their origins and the eras in which they were
born.</p>
<p>During the Internet era, the concept of personal computers hadn’t
even developed yet, let alone the idea of connecting individuals around
the country, or around the world.</p>
<p>Companies springing up during this type focused primarily on
corporations, leading to several “intranet” projects, analogous to
private blockchains.</p>
<p>With blockchain, we see the same patterns, but on a much larger.</p>
<p>In this era of connectivity and social images, information spreads
much more quickly, as does haste.</p>
<p>Most projects target the general public instead of corporations, but
these projects also come to fruition much less frequently.</p>
<p>Many teams settle for an excellent marketing team, launch an ICO, and
pray for no lawsuit.</p>
<p>In terms of use cases, it’s easy to see that the purpose of the
Internet differs massively from blockchain, though they share parallels
when it comes to the manner in which their use cases and ecosystem
develop.</p>
<p>The Internet focuses much more on information exchange, while
blockchain focuses on value exchange.</p>
<p>When thinking about a blockchain use case, ask yourself whether it
leverages some value exchange, particularly that which cannot be handled
by a single authority.</p>
<p>Blockchain’s innovation was not to enable distributed information
sharing, but distributed record-keeping and decentralized exchange of
value.</p>
<h3 id="blockchain-generalizations">Blockchain Generalizations</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve seen all these use cases, let’s go ahead and finish
off with some generalizations.</p>
<p>These points can be used to understand and discuss any use case you
come across or come up with.</p>
<p>These points describe the properties of a good blockchain use case,
along with the scenarios in which a blockchain is not needed or inferior
to a centralized solution.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------- Blockchain Generalizations: Viable but Blockchain Not Necessary ----------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image355.png” “Blockchain Generalizations:
Viable but Blockchain Not Necessary” style=“width:5in;height:2.85in”
/&gt;  </p>
<p>To start off, let’s talk about the scenarios where a blockchain will
work, but is not necessary.</p>
<p>We often hear the term “efficiency” in the context of blockchain use
cases, but this isn’t often applicable.</p>
<p>For example, let’s take Bitcoin.</p>
<p>If I’m buying coffee, it’s less efficient to send Bitcoin and wait 10
minutes for a confirmation than to hand over a few dollars or use a
credit card.</p>
<p>However, it is more efficient to send value overseas with Bitcoin,
which takes a mere ten minutes in comparison to the days that banks take
to coordinate… and the transaction fees they levy for international
transfers of value.</p>
<p>Hence, efficiency depends on context.</p>
<p>The other bullet points listed below are properties of blockchain
that are not exclusive to blockchain.</p>
<p>For example, just because you didn’t hear of fault tolerance,
consensus, or public key cryptography before blockchain doesn’t mean
that blockchain’s the only way to do it.</p>
<p>Each of these bullets can be achieved by using a subset of the
technology that goes into making a blockchain.</p>

<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image356.png” “Blockchain Generalizations:
Solving Coordination Failures” style=“width:5in;height:2.85in” /&gt;
 </p>
<p>While blockchains will work, they’re over-engineered solutions to
these problems.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the smart energy grid example, blockchains allow us
to solve coordination failures.</p>
<p>We are able to implement arbitrary incentive schemes, allowing us to
create a system which incentivizes individuals to operate according to
our expectations.</p>
<p>In addition, blockchain can be thought of as a “technological
solution to a social problem.”</p>
<p>Theoretically, every blockchain protocol could be run by a single
node.</p>
<p>However, you’ll notice the issue that if only one person runs the
protocol, then we lose out on the guarantees of auditability and
decentralized control, properties that are meaningful only in a social
setting.</p>
<p>When individuals don’t trust each other, then the blockchain allows
them to coordinate between each other without relying on some trusted
third party.</p>
<p>With this, smart contracts can be used to make commitments, to fund
public infrastructure or do crowdfunding.</p>
<p>The miners will force the actors to honor their commitments, as was
the original intention of smart contracts.</p>
<p>Instead of bringing in lawyers to settle matters when things don’t
according to plan, we’re now able to rely on a smart contract to execute
as intended, giving us the ability to believe in this code as law.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------- Blockchain Generalizations: Horizontal Integration ------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image357.png” “Blockchain Generalizations:
Horizontal Integration” style=“width:5in;height:2.85in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>Blockchains create a standardized platform for access and
interaction.</p>
<p>Because of this, we can combine the power of all users on a
blockchain to enhance everyone’s capabilities.</p>
<p>Given that all information in a blockchain is accessible to everyone,
we are now able to combine data silos between institutions.</p>
<p>Any information collected or functionality provided by an app on the
Ethereum Blockchain is accessible to all other users on the blockchain,
something which can’t be said about the Internet alone.</p>
<p>In addition, blockchains enforce a common standard.</p>
<p>As all users tap into the same single protocol, they must also adapt
to that protocol’s specifications.</p>
<p>Granted, that requires everyone to go through the trouble of
adapting.</p>
<p>However, once everyone’s on the same platform, there are no longer
issues of format or syntax.</p>
<p>Lastly, by combining resources and information from all parties, we
can enhance everyone’s user experience.</p>
<p>Any app that exists on a smart contract platform has its data and
functionality living in that platform.</p>
<p>Any other app can leverage existing technologies on the same
platform, creating a positive feedback loop and benefiting all
involved.</p>
<p>This is referred to as network effects, which is the increased value
or potential of a product with every additional user.</p>
<p>Similar to how more Facebook users makes the platform more worthwhile
for all users, more smart contract developers increases the value of a
platform.</p>
<p>In this way, individuals are supporting the rest of the community
while benefiting themselves as well.</p>

<!--------------------- Blockchain Generalizations: Essential Properties ------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image358.png” “Blockchain Generalizations:
Essential Properties” style=“width:5in;height:2.85in” /&gt;  </p>
<p><img src="/images/image369.png" style="width:5in;height:2.83301in" /></p>
<p>Finally, the most abstract yet fundamental property of a good
blockchain use case is pure decentralization.</p>
<p>What this means is decentralization for the sake of keeping it out of
the hands of a central authority.</p>
<p>This is what Bitcoin aimed to do with banks.</p>
<p>Although there was a working central solution, Bitcoin wanted
decentralization nevertheless.</p>
<p>In countries with significant amounts of distrust in central
authorities due to corruption or inefficiency, blockchain might be
useful.</p>
<p>Blockchain provides a system for users to produce guarantees that a
central solution cannot provide, such as censorship-resistance and
disinterimagestion of power.</p>
<p>These properties are difficult to evaluate in terms of dollars and
cents, but groups like cypherpunks and crypto-anarchists ask about
finances second.</p>
<p>For some individuals, self-governance and privacy is more important
than any amount of revenue, making decentralization for
decentralization’s sake worthwhile.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most astonishing property that a blockchain provides is
globally recognized proofs.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies aren’t divided by lines or borders–they’re
guaranteed to be globally accessible and unstoppable as long as there
exists a community to support them, unlike businesses or government
projects.</p>
<p>Through blockchain, we can support globally recognized ownership,
persisting across nations.</p>

<!--------------- Blockchain Generalizations: Advantages of Centralized Solutions ---------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image359.png” “Blockchain Generalizations:
Advantages of Centralized Solutions” style=“width:5in;height:2.85in”
/&gt;  </p>
<p>Now that we’ve finished talking about all the meaningful properties
of decentralized solutions, it wouldn’t be complete if we didn’t go over
the caveats.</p>
<p>What are the costs of these properties of decentralization?</p>
<p>What do we achieve better with centralized solutions?</p>
<p>The overarching theme of centralized solutions is the benefit of
independence.</p>
<p>There’s no need for consensus when a single party has the power to
make decisions.</p>
<p>Because of this, we get the following benefits:</p>
<p>First and foremost, we have deep integration.</p>
<p>A central solution has full control over everything under its
umbrella.</p>
<p>Apple is well known for taking advantage of this to control the user
experience.</p>
<p>When a blockchain attempts to upgrade its protocol, all users have to
voluntarily upgrade or get left behind.</p>
<p>With a central solution, however, it’s much easier to change
individual components or entire architectures of projects.</p>
<p>Because of this, it’s much easier for a centralized systems to patch
up bugs, such as security issues, than decentralized systems.</p>
<p>A central solution does what it needs to do, unrestricted, but a
decentralized system needs to come to consensus with thousands of
different actors to change anything at the protocol level.</p>
<p>Another huge advantage for central solutions is efficiency.</p>
<p>With centralized solutions, the cost of executing a program is about
a million times less work than decentralized solutions.</p>
<p>This is easy to see, as only one party is doing work, and it doesn’t
need to confirm the result of its work with anyone else.</p>
<p>In addition, only one store of data is required.</p>
<p>The data doesn’t isn’t replicated across thousands of nodes.</p>
<p>In addition, access control is simpler in a central solution, where
it’s much easier to restrict read and write permissions.</p>
<p>In a decentralized solution with censorship-resistance, we give up
that control.</p>
<p>Building off that, central solutions handle complexity well.</p>
<p>Imagine replicating Airbnb using smart contracts.</p>
<p>If a landlord finds their house destroyed, a blockchain can’t handle
that scenario.</p>
<p>How can an oracle accurately report whether a tenant damaged
household possessions?</p>
<p>Who would report that information?</p>
<p>It’s much easier to trust a single person to report on the state of
the house than to implement a complex and likely unreliable oracle
system.</p>
<p>Finally, central solutions are adaptive.</p>
<p>When an Uber driver is having trouble with their passenger, or the
other way around, who do they call for customer support on a blockchain
solution?</p>
<p>How do they get this issue resolved?</p>
<p>Centralized solutions have the advantage of handling messy situations
with grace, since you don’t need every single entity to agree on every
single outcome.</p>
<p>If you do integrate centralization with a blockchain solution, you
lose out on most of the benefits of decentralization.</p>
<h3 id="supplement-use-cases">Supplement: Use Cases</h3>
<p>Authors: Rea Savla and David Luo</p>
<h3 id="i.-basic-use-cases">I. Basic Use Cases</h3>
<p>The first use case is a smart asset, or token, built on a currently
existing blockchain. All that needs to be done is to ensure that a user
who wants to spend money has the funds, has been authenticated, and is
not double spending.</p>
<p>Another meaningful use case for smart contracts is multisignature
wallets. On Ethereum, we can leverage the platform’s built-in
authentication protocol to create a functionality that allows us to have
an m of n signature scheme (refer to Lecture 3).</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------- Document Ownership: Blockchain Fundamentals: Proof-of-Existence ------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/document-ownership.png” “Document Ownership:
Blockchain Fundamentals: Proof-of-Existence”
style=“width:5in;height:2.85in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>We can also create Proof-of-Existence use cases using smart
contracts, which hash intellectual property onto a blockchain to prove
the existence of some piece of information at some point in time. With
Proof-of-Existence, we leverage both the public auditability and
immutability of the blockchain. We can use Proof-of-Existence to record
document ownership or implement a decentralized DNS system.</p>
<h3 id="ii.-advanced-use-cases">II. Advanced Use Cases</h3>
<p>Many developing nations struggle with broken land titles systems;
flawed paperwork, forged signatures, and unclear documents make tracing
ownership of land difficult. The pitfalls which keep a central
organization from solving this problem are mistrust between citizens and
these central parties.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Ownership helps address these issues by tracking ownership
of documents, similar to Proof-of-Existence. We can create an
association between users and document hashes to prove ownership. This
provides transparency and immutability, and it limits centralization. A
major caveat to this use case is “Garbage in Garbage Out” (GIGO), which
states that if the inputs are incorrect, the outputs will also be
incorrect. We refer to the entities that send information from the real
world into the blockchain as “oracles.”</p>
<p>Prediction markets are another advanced use case of smart contracts.
A prediction market allows users to bet on the future and receive
winnings if they bet correctly.</p>
<p>We can use prediction markets to “buy information.” Use cases of
prediction markets include insurance, bug bounties, ICO signaling, and
futarchy.</p>
<p>Smart contracts also have significant potential to secure supply
chains. Everledger was created to tokenize and track a diamond’s path
from mining to current product.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a digital service, blockchain can also be
used to provide a real world service, such as providing infrastructure
in the absence of government action to do so. A common infrastructure
problem is that of energy grids. Individual households can create smart
contracts that promise to pay a certain amount of money to build an
electric grid if neighboring households commit to doing the same. A
contractor can then redeem the money in exchange of working on the grid.
Through smart contracts, we can coordinate between untrusting parties
without a central entity.</p>
<p>Finally, blockchain can also allow us to conduct after hours trading
by solving the “Liquidity Problem,” which causes the SEC to restrict
after hour trading to placing limit orders. With blockchain, brokers can
tokenize stocks by creating legal contracts underwriting them. Stock
tokens can be traded worldwide even after the markets close and redeemed
for their respective stocks during business hours.</p>
<h3 id="iii.-blockchain-generalizations-essential-properties">III.
Blockchain Generalizations: Essential Properties </h3>
<p>Although using blockchain provides numerous properties if implemented
in a system, there are often other solutions that provide the desired
properties without using a blockchain.</p>
<p>Blockchains provide guarantees of privacy, decentralization, and
more. However, these properties are sometimes unaffordable for practical
use depending on the user base, goals, and scale of the application.</p>
<h3 id="iii.i-efficiency">III.I Efficiency</h3>
<p>The word “efficiency” is often used when used to describe
blockchains, but blockchains are not always efficient for their proposed
use cases they are proposed for. For example, if one wanted to purchase
a coffee using bitcoin, it is far less efficient to wait 10 minutes for
a confirmation than it is to simply swipe a credit card or hand the
cashier some money. However, sending money across the world using
Bitcoin would take a mere ten minutes, compared to the days for
coordination between banks internationally. As shown, there are numerous
properties that a blockchain provides if implemented, but sometimes
there is no need to implement a blockchain in order to achieve these
properties for specific uses cases. Efficiency depends on whether the
immense cost and complexity of decentralized consensus is overcome by
the benefits of blockchain.</p>
<p>In addition, properties like data immutability , integrity,
auditability, authenticity, and public key identity infrastructures are
all very powerful properties provides by blockchains that a blockchain
can possess, but can all be achievable by using previously existing
technologies, like cryptography and implementing a system with a hash
chains. Redundant, mission-critical, fault-tolerant systems already
exist in the form of secure servers or cloud services like such as
Amazon Web Services. In addition, these centralized solutions are
literally millions of times less expensive to run than current
decentralized solutions. Although by definition a blockchain possesses
these properties, a centralized solution can just as well implement
these, usually cheaper as well.</p>
<h3 id="iii.ii-solving-coordination-failures">III.II Solving
coordination failures</h3>
<p>One major property of a blockchain system is its ability to create
arbitrary incentive structures so as to solve coordination failures. By
offering rewards for users to act a certain way, a system can therefore
incentivize them to follow those certain expectations. Because of this,
blockchain can be considered a “technological solution to a social
problem.” This is especially useful in use cases where individuals do
not trust each, but could benefit from working together. Blockchain
allows for them to still coordinate or collaborate without the need for
a trusted third party. Funding public infrastructure/crowdfunding is one
such example for coordination, such as with the smart energy grid
example, which uses smart contracts in order to create a common law
without a third party.</p>
<h3 id="iii.iii-horizontal-integration">III.III Horizontal
Integration</h3>
<p>Blockchains create a standardized platform for access and
interaction, combining the power of all users to enhance all of their
capabilities. One such example of this is the combining of data silos.
Since all information that is stored on a blockchain is shared, it is
accessible for all users on the chain. Any individual contribution to
the chain increases the protocol’s value for all. This property, along
with that of enforcing having a common formatting standards, is known as
network effects, which is the increased value of potential of a product
for each additional user. Users support the entire community while also
benefiting themselves.</p>
<h3 id="iii.iv-pure-decentralization">III.IV Pure decentralization</h3>
<p>One of the largest selling points of using a blockchain is its
decentralization. Pure decentralization refers to decentralization for
decentralization’s sake, such as Bitcoin avoiding the functioning bank
system out of distrust. So if it required to avoid a centralized
authority, a blockchain would be a good solution to this issue. This
extends to scenarios of corruption or power saturation in central
authorities, such as governments and financial institutions. In a
situation where there is a lack of trust in the government due to
corruption, a blockchain could be implemented. This decentralization
paves the path to also create censorship resistance and
disinterimagestion of power. Because blockchains are globally
accessible, they are unstoppable as long as there is a community that
supports them.</p>
<h3 id="iii.v-advantages-of-centralized-solutions">III.V Advantages of
centralized solutions</h3>
<p>A central solution is fully controlled by a single organization,
keeping everything under the same umbrella. One of the benefits of this
is simpler and faster software updates, meaning it is easy to make
changes and have the update for all users. Contrast this with a
blockchain, where everyone instead must have to voluntarily agree to
upgrade. It is much easier to make security patches when you don’t need
to reach consensus on upgrades across all users. Centralized solutions
are also more efficient, as instead of having to do a computation for
every user in a network, it only needs to be done once, and there is no
need for verification. Access control is also much easier, as the
central authority can simply keep track of access in a centrally
controlled database, something that cannot be done in a decentralized
system. Most significantly, centralized systems can make decisions with
their human judgment, especially helpful when tackling complex
decisions. In a decentralized system, smart contracts may not be able to
cover or formalize all of the edge cases, and may not be suitable for
use in more complex issues. For example, if Airbnb were replaced by used
smart contracts, how would a smart contract be able to determine what to
do if household possessions were damaged? Which individuals could be
trusted to report this information without stripping away the values of
decentralization? How would a smart contract handle human error?</p>
<p>In the end, it is important to always ask why a blockchain is better
than a centralized solution. Neither is better than the other
universally, so it is important to compare the pros and cons of both to
determine which one is better for each specific use case.</p>

<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image360.png” “Blockchain Use Cases Takeaways”
style=“width:5in;height:2.85in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>The main takeaway is that there are advantages to both centralized
and decentralized solutions.</p>
<p>Neither is universally better than the other; they each have their
own use cases.</p>
<p>However, the best solutions are those that recognize when
decentralization is critical to accomplishing some goal and don’t get
distracted when a blockchain is viable but really doesn’t make
sense.</p>
<p>A good blockchain use case is like an oasis in a desert.</p>
<p>Mirages pop up all the time, but that doesn’t make them the real
deal.</p>
<p>Be sure that you’re able to justify why a blockchain works for your
use case!</p>
<h3 id="intro-ethereum-ecosystem">Intro: Ethereum Ecosystem</h3>
<p>Just like with Bitcoin, the Ethereum ecosystem is constantly
changing.</p>
<p>However, you can argue that Ethereum is a bit more politically
centralized.</p>
<p>They have more recognizable people.</p>
<p>After all, we know that Vitalik Buterin created Ethereum, but what do
we know about Satoshi Nakamoto?</p>
<p>Knowing some of the key players in the space will get you an upper
hand in understanding what’s happening right now, and where things are
heading.</p>
<p>It’ll also introduce you to ways Ethereum and its community are
pushing the blockchain space forward.</p>
<h3 id="community-leaders">Community Leaders</h3>
<p>So, of course the biggest face in Ethereum is Vitalik Buterin.</p>
<p>He created Ethereum, and also co-founded the Bitcoin Magazine, both
when he was under 20 years old.</p>
<p>Some people argue that he represents a point of centralization behind
Ethereum.</p>
<p>He’s the personality driving Ethereum forward, and he’s a pretty
likable guy, but what happens when he steps aside?</p>
<p>His opinion can very easily shape the entire space, and he controls a
lot of influence.</p>
<p>Actually, just recently (5/23/18), Vitalik posted on Twitter that
Google had reached out to him to try to hire him for a top secret
blockchain project.</p>
<p>This is interesting especially since Google banned cryptocurrency and
ICO ads on their search engine earlier this year.</p>
<p>Vitalik didn’t take the job, and instead made a poll on Twitter on
whether or not he should take the job as a joke.</p>
<p>Vitalik currently leads Ethereum’s research team, which contains
another key player: Vlad Zamfir.</p>
<p>Vlad is very outspoken and is a self-proclaimed troll, and often
times disagrees with Vitalik: making for a culture of healthy debate
within the space.</p>
<p>Notably, Vitalik and Vlad have different visions for Ethereum’s
upgrade to Proof-of-Stake, an alternative consensus mechanism to
Proof-of-Work.</p>
<p>We’ll explore this in our second course.</p>
<p>Gavin Wood is a co-founder and former CTO of Ethereum, and is famous
for originally proposing Solidity as a high level programming language
on top of the EVM.</p>
<p>He’s the current CTO and Chairman of Parity technologies, which
recently has been famous for the Parity wallet hacks.</p>
<p>Nick Szabo is a researcher in digital contracts and digital
currency.</p>
<p>He is known for designing Bitgold way back in 1998, and also for
coining the term “smart contract.”</p>
<p>Being an academic with quite a large internet presence, his articles

<p>Andreas Antonopoulos is the author of Mastering Bitcoin, which is an

<p>He’s an author, educator, and speaker.</p>
<p>He’s also known for coining the term “Internet of Money”, writing two
books called The Internet of Money (volumes 1 and 2) and also Mastering
Ethereum.</p>
<p>Joseph Lubin was a co-founder of Ethereum.</p>

what it calls “spoke ventures.”</p>

<p>There’s also Plasma, a proposed scalability upgrade to Ethereum

<p>You can see the resemblance in the name.</p>

<h1 id="lecture-6-summary">Lecture 6: Summary</h1>
<h3 id="i.-smart-contracts">I. Smart Contracts</h3>
<p>Smart contracts on Ethereum enable us to execute arbitrary
computations on the blockchain. A smart contract is a piece of code that
facilitates, verifies, or enforces the negotiation or execution of a
digital contract. For us to reach consensus, a trusted entity must run
this code.</p>
<h3 id="ii.-ethereum">II. Ethereum</h3>
<p>Ethereum is a decentralized platform designed to run smart contracts.
It is a distributed computer spread across many nodes around the world
that executes the code people feed in it, without any possibility of
downtime, fraud, censorship, or third-party intervention.</p>
<p>Here’s a review of the similarity and differences between Ethereum
and Bitcoin:</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!--------- Table reviewing the similarities and differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin -------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image363.jpg” “Bitcoin Network: Flood the
Network” style=“width:6in;height:2.5in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>There are two kinds of Ethereum accounts: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Externally Owned Accounts contain an address that allows people
to send them ether and a balance of ether</p></li>
<li><p>Contract Accounts contain an address, persistent storage, and
code which is executed by transactions or function calls</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ethereum smart contracts generally serve four main purposes: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Store and maintain data</p></li>
<li><p>Manage contract or relationship between untrusting users</p></li>
<li><p>Provide functions to other contracts</p></li>
<li><p>Complex authentication</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iii.-ethereum-virtual-machines">III. Ethereum Virtual
Machines</h3>
<p>The Ethereum Virtual Machine enables the Ethereum blockchain to be
programmable. Ethereum Smart Contracts are written in high level
programming languages like Solidity, which have to be compiled down to
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) code. Every node runs EVM as part of its
block verification procedure. Once the contract code is compiled to EVM
code, every node in the Ethereum network executes the code. Nodes then
come to consensus on the new system state. Note: Ethereum is redundantly
parallel; its main goal is not to optimize computational efficiency, but
to enable distributed and trustless computation.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------------- Nodes in the Ethereum Network ------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<p>&lt;img src=“/images/image364.jpg” “Nodes in the Ethereum Network”
style=“width:5in;height:2.5in” /&gt;  </p>
<p>As in Bitcoin, the nodes come to consensus using Proof-of-Work,
removing the need for a trusted third party. Miners in Ethereum
competitively create blocks by executing EVM code and searching for a
solution to a mining puzzle.</p>
<p>The developers of Ethereum implemented ‘gas’ to protect against the
Denial of Service (DoS) Attack, where an attacker includes an infinite
loop in the smart contract to disable nodes from executing any other
contracts. Gas is what fuels a given contract. You can think of
purchasing gas as the price you have to pay to use this distributed,
trustless computational power. This disincentivizes DoS attacks because
attackers would have to pay an absurdly large amount of ether to execute
this attack.</p>
<p>Ethereum is implemented as a distributed state machine, and
transactions on the network change the global state of the system. In
the transaction execution, or “state transition function,” nodes in
Ethereum come to consensus on the network state, and their code
execution on the EVM changes the global state from the previous state to
the new state. The function looks like this:</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<p>Congratulations on completing the course!</p>
<p>On behalf of all of our lovely course staff, I’d like to thank you
for finishing part one of the Blockchain Fundamentals program: Bitcoin
and Cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>With this first step into cryptocurrencies and blockchain, you now
likely have a much better understanding of the space than most of your
peers.</p>
<p>You understand the fundamentals and vulnerabilities of Bitcoin, the
first use of blockchain, and Ethereum, a generalization of Bitcoin
designed to simulate a distributed computer.</p>
<p>By understanding the technical and cultural aspects of Bitcoin,
Ethereum, and blockchain, you can apply that experience to understand
and analyze any blockchain platform or use case you may encounter.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoyed this first part of the Blockchain Fundamentals
program.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for more, there’s still a great deal of complexity
and innovation left to explore, so I cordially invite you to take our
second course, CS198.2x Blockchain Technology.</p>
<p>We wish you all the best on the rest of your blockchain journey!</p>
<p>the end…</p>
